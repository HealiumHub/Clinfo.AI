    "If you have done tutorial 01, you can skip the next steps, if not, you will need to follow them to get the credentials, KEYs needed to run clinfo.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.- Setting up enviorment:\n",
    "1.a.- Install the conda enviroment using the yml file provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda env create -f environment.yaml ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.b.- Select your enviorment to run notebook. I recommend using vscode: \n",

    "### 2.- Creating Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need at least one account and at most two (depending on how many calls/hour you plan to do):\n",
    "* OPENAI account: If you start a free account for the first time, you will get $5 in API credits.\n",
    "* NCBI_API_KEY: This is only necessary if you plan to make more than 10 calls per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created both accounts  go to **src\\config.py** file and: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Set OPENAI_API_KEY to your openAI API key\n",
    "\n",
    "If you created an NCBI API account add your key and email in the following values: \n",
