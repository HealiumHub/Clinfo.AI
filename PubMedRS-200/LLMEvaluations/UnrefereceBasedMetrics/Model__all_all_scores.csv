allergy and immunology,asthma,Are prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms associated with asthma or atopic diseases throughout the offspring's childhood? An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age. Studies suggested that these conditions might be related to prenatal depression or anxiety. This study aimed to explore the association between prenatal mental disorders and childhood asthma or atopic disease in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, and theÂ Cochrane Library were searched up to May 2020. The primary outcome was childhood asthma and childhood atopic dermatitis. Random-effects models were used because of high heterogeneity indicated by I<sup>2</sup>â>â50% and Q-test Pâ<â0.10.

RESULTS:
A total of 598 studies were initially identified, but nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Prenatal mental disorder was associated with childhood asthma (nâ=â6 studies; ESâ=â1.146, 95%CI: 1.054-1.245, Pâ=â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â93.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001) whereas no significant association was found for childhood atopic dermatitis (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.211, 95%CI: 0.982-1.494, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â78.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001). Childhood asthma seems to be related more to depression (nâ=â1 study; ESâ=â1.170, 95%CI: 1.061-1.291, Pâ=â0.002) and anxiety/depression (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.157, 95%CI: 1.050-1.275, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â95.3%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001).

CONCLUSION:
This meta-analysis demonstrated that prenatal mental disorders increase the risk of childhood asthma. We limited the included samples to pregnant women to investigate the association between prenatal psychological factors and offspring's physical health. Future studies should include large high-quality cohort studies to investigate the behavioral, environmental, and genetic causes for this association.","Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age.

A large population-based prospective cohort study found that maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of childhood inhalant allergy and eczema, but not allergic sensitization [1]. Similarly, a longitudinal birth cohort study found that maternal depression during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in infants, while maternal anxiety was linked to an increased risk of rhinitis [10]. Another study found that cumulative exposure to maternal depression or anxiety was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma [14]. A study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort also suggested a dose-response relationship between prenatal anxiety and asthma at age 7(1/2) years [15]. Some studies have suggested that maternal prenatal psychological symptoms may be associated with altered immune functioning in the offspring, potentially increasing the risk of atopic diseases [11]. However, one cohort study found that antidepressant use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of asthma overall, although the use of older antidepressants was associated with an increased risk [17].

TL;DR: There is evidence suggesting that prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms may be associated with an increased risk of asthma or atopic diseases in offspring, though the strength of the association may vary depending on factors such as the specific psychiatric symptoms, the timing and duration of exposure, and the use of antidepressant medication during pregnancy.

","The exact etiology of asthma is multifactorial and not completely understood, however there is evidence supporting an association between prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms and asthma or atopic diseases throughout childhood. Maternal smoking has been shown to increase the risk for wheezing and asthma during childhood, while other proposed prenatal risk factors such as maternal diet and nutrition, stress, antibiotics, and delivery via Cesarean section show inconclusive results. Additionally, parental interaction, family size and structure, and socioeconomic environment have been linked to an increased risk for asthma, but the evidence is inconclusive. Although viral lower respiratory infections and the use of antibiotics can trigger asthma, causation is uncertain.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Should we care about Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection? A systematic review and a cases series from the Brazilian Amazon.,"BACKGROUND:
Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues. However, evidence on HIV-Plasmodium vivax co-infection (HIV/PvCo) is scarce, with most of the available information related to Plasmodium falciparum on the African continent. It is unclear whether HIV can change the clinical course of vivax malaria and increase the risk of complications. In this study, a systematic review of HIV/PvCo studies was performed, and recent cases from the Brazilian Amazon were included.

METHODS:
Medical records from a tertiary care centre in the Western Brazilian Amazon (2009-2018) were reviewed to identify HIV/PvCo hospitalized patients. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes are reported. Also, a systematic review of published studies on HIV/PvCo was conducted. Metadata, number of HIV/PvCo cases, demographic, clinical, and outcome data were extracted.

RESULTS:
A total of 1,048 vivax malaria patients were hospitalized in the 10-year period; 21 (2.0%) were HIV/PvCo cases, of which 9 (42.9%) had AIDS-defining illnesses. This was the first malaria episode in 11 (52.4%) patients. Seven (33.3%) patients were unaware of their HIV status and were diagnosed on hospitalization. Severe malaria was diagnosed in 5 (23.8%) patients. One patient died. The systematic review search provided 17 articles (12 cross-sectional or longitudinal studies and 5 case report studies). A higher prevalence of studies involved cases in African and Asian countries (35.3 and 29.4%, respectively), and the prevalence of reported co-infections ranged from 0.1 to 60%.

CONCLUSION:
Reports of HIV/PvCo are scarce in the literature, with only a few studies describing clinical and laboratory outcomes. Systematic screening for both co-infections is not routinely performed, and therefore the real prevalence of HIV/PvCo is unknown. This study showed a low prevalence of HIV/PvCo despite the high prevalence of malaria and HIV locally. Even though relatively small, this is the largest case series to describe HIV/PvCo.","Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues.

An in vitro study suggested that HIV-1 aspartic protease inhibitors may have prophylactic activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria in HIV-infected patients in areas with multidrug-resistant malaria [6]. However, some studies have also indicated that HIV status was not associated with hospitalizations due to P. vivax malaria, and CD4+ counts and viral load were not associated with P. vivax malaria recurrences [7].

"," Given the evidence, clinicians should be aware of the potential for Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection, especially in regions where both diseases are prevalent, as it may impact disease severity and treatment strategies.

"," Studies have shown that Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection is prevalent in several regions, including Ethiopia [1], India [5], and the Brazilian Amazon [7,8]. In Ethiopia, 3.13% of febrile patients were found to be co-infected with HIV and malaria [1]. In India, 9.8% of HIV-infected individuals had recent malaria co-infection, with P. vivax accounting for the majority of infections [5]. In the Brazilian Amazon, HIV-positive individuals had a significantly higher risk of acquiring P. vivax malaria compared to HIV-negative individuals [7]. Furthermore, a systematic review found that the prevalence of HIV/P. vivax co-infection ranged from 0.1% to 60% [8]. However, the actual prevalence of co-infection is unknown due to the scarcity of reports and lack of systematic screening [8]. In terms of disease severity, HIV co-infection was associated with higher parasite density and a higher frequency of anemia in malaria patients [6]. HIV-1 aspartic protease inhibitors, used in antiretroviral regimens, may have prophylactic activity against both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria [12]. 

"," Given the evidence, we should care about Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection due to its prevalence in certain regions and its potential to increase disease severity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the implications of co-infection.

","We should be aware of the potential for Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection, as the combined infections can interact and lead to poorer outcomes than either infection alone. Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malaria species, with over 2.5 billion people at risk of infection, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Although individuals with low expression of the Duffy antigen are thought to be resistant to infection, there have been a few documented cases of P. vivax in Duffy-null Africans. As such, evaluation and early recognition of dual infection with HIV-1 to rule out should be done during laboratory testing. Mortality from P. vivax is lower than that of P. falciparum, but severity of disease can still occur, particularly in low transmission settings.",0.7380086779594421,0.13986013986013987,0.0946073793755913,16.173938749514967,0.04484304932735426,1.0,0.0,0.47408257779124735,0.2516619927598992,0.7450070977210999,0.1267605633802817,0.11168717047451668,17.41163340941616,0.04811715481171548,1.0,0.0,0.4590839587602039,0.24942028075339984,0.7405591011047363,0.0921985815602837,0.04411764705882353,8.586764842019388,0.02495201535508637,1.0,0.0,0.4424139437661774,0.2542075954565167,0.741412878036499,0.09876543209876543,0.057331911690918225,9.828321662648014,0.028735632183908046,1.0,0.0,0.44869120519708944,0.25558051758051836,0.7747237682342529,0.15789473684210525,0.1534526854219949,28.25707390381774,0.06470588235294118,0.9640456989247312,0.0,0.4998483052279087,0.25612900120203425,0.7464407086372375,0.1,0.048415492957746484,9.182526486562526,0.02485089463220676,1.0,0.0,0.45856907785900175,0.26258739079964466,0.7478611469268799,0.08928571428571429,0.04992117708880715,10.311397254464007,0.026128266033254157,1.0,0.0,0.4636342807519482,0.26425268642372646,0.7887094616889954,0.136986301369863,0.20107238605898123,30.18411413903933,0.07647058823529412,0.948891129032258,0.0,0.5353150706399571,0.27073618578636033,0.7518417835235596,0.10038610038610038,0.06209392664350001,11.857881290278677,0.030947775628626693,1.0,0.0,0.4517103114889728,0.26823143922244824,0.7534018158912659,0.11981566820276496,0.08891600232725111,14.168262738662246,0.03764705882352941,1.0,0.0,0.4557552140995472,0.2706823000491837,0.7850820422172546,0.1518987341772152,0.1555023923444976,29.74379710857718,0.07647058823529412,0.9147849462365591,0.0,0.5249132594466209,0.26864071532168304,0.8623077273368835,0.4041450777202072,0.2455609084652443,31.8918270721116,0.2448377581120944,1.0,0.0,0.6233441097289324,0.36711002284387234,0.7726214528083801,0.1317365269461078,0.09836116487080239,15.15276324436755,0.04181818181818182,1.0,0.0,0.5022091141768864,0.27730792368720203
allergy and immunology,HIV,Bladder Cancer in HIV-infected Adults: An Emerging Issue? Case-Reports and Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES:
Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Albeit bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, it has been rarely reported among HIV-infected patients. We wished to assess the prevalence and characteristics of bladder cancer in HIV-infected patients.

METHODS:
We conducted a single center retrospective study from 1998 to 2013 in a university hospital in Paris. Cases of bladder cancer among HIV-infected patients were identified using the electronic records of the hospital database and of the HIV-infected cohort. Patient characteristics and outcomes were retrieved from patients charts. A systematic review of published cases of bladder cancers in patients with HIV-infection was also performed.

RESULTS:
During the study period we identified 15 HIV-infected patients (0.2% of the cohort) with a bladder cancer. Patients were mostly men (73%) and smokers (67%), with a median age of 56 years at cancer diagnosis. Bladder cancer was diagnosed a median of 14 years after HIV-infection. Most patients were on ART (86%) with median current and nadir CD4 cell counts of 506 and 195 cells/mm3, respectively. Haematuria (73%) was the most frequent presenting symptom and HPV-associated lesions were seen in 6/10 (60%) patients. Histopathology showed transitional cell carcinoma in 80% and a high proportion of tumors with muscle invasion (47%) and high histologic grade (73%). One-year survival rate was 74.6%. The systematic review identified 13 additional cases of urothelial bladder cancers which shared similar features.

CONCLUSIONS:
Bladder cancers in HIV-infected patients remain rare but may occur in relatively young patients with a low nadir CD4 cell count, have aggressive pathological features and can be fatal.","Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients.

Bladder cancers in HIV-infected patients remain rare but may occur in relatively young patients with a low nadir CD4 cell count, have aggressive pathological features and can be fatal."," HIV-infected patients may have a higher prevalence of certain neoplasms, including bladder cancer, compared to the general population [1]. Bladder cancer has been identified as part of the growing list of cancers that may be encountered in patients with chronic HIV infection [2]. However, bladder transitional cell carcinoma associated with HIV infection is considered rare with only a limited number of cases reported [3]. An urban cohort of HIV patients showed a higher incidence of bladder cancer compared to the general population with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.79 [4]. A retrospective study of 3554 HIV patients identified bladder cancer among other malignancies with a significantly elevated SIR [7]. Another study involving 1042 patients identified bladder cancer among the most common non-AIDS defining malignancies (NADM) [10]. A study in France found 15 cases of bladder cancer in HIV-infected patients out of 6353 patients in their HIV database [11]. Despite these findings, a study in India involving 2598 HIV-infected adult patients with 8315 person-years of follow-up found no cases of bladder cancer [12].

TL;DR: While bladder cancer is not commonly reported in HIV-infected individuals, the incidence may be higher than in the general population, although more research is needed to confirm this.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Is having sex with other men a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections in male blood donors in Western countries? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.

METHODS:
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.

RESULTS:
Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.

CONCLUSIONS:
High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.","Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested.

This is because men who have sex with men (MSM) have a higher prevalence of certain infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, compared to the general population. These infections can be transmitted through blood transfusions if the donor is infected but not aware of their status. Therefore, blood donation guidelines in Western countries often include deferral periods for MSM to mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections.","The papers suggest that having sex with other men is a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) in male blood donors in Western countries, particularly for HIV-1. Buck (2015) found that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections, and Germain (2016) suggests that allowing blood donation from MSM after a temporary deferral may increase the number of HIV-positive donations obtained from unknowingly infected, abstinent MSM. However, the evidence is limited and of low quality due to risk of bias and imprecision of the results. Remoortel (2019) aimed to scientifically underpin blood donor deferral policies by identifying the best available evidence on the association between sexual risk behavior and the risk of TTIs, but did not specifically focus on MSM. SÃÂ¡nchez (2005) found that excluding only men who engaged in male-to-male sex within either the prior 12 months or 5 years has been proposed, but little is known about infectious disease risks of MSM who donate blood."," The literature highlights the ongoing challenges with preventing transfusion-transmissible infections, particularly HIV, among men who have sex with men (MSM) globally [2].

","Having sex with other men is not considered a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections in male blood donors in Western countries. In these countries, screening procedures for transfusion-transmitted infections are highly stringent and involve questionnaires and NAT technology. In the United States, highly sensitive screening questionnaires and testing are designed to identify and defer high-risk donors, and this can exclude up to 90% of potentially infectious donors. Although the risk of viral infections through blood transfusions is very low, risk estimates are determined by mathematical models and it is important to have preventative measures in place.

A systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (1945-2016) for the terms AD, atopic eczema (AE), and multiple other eczematous disorders.

RESULTS:
In MEDLINE, 33 060 were identified, of which 21 299 (64.4%) publications used the term 'AD', 15 510 (46.9%) 'eczema', and only 2471 (7.5%) AE. Most of these publications used the term AD (82.0%) or eczema (70.8%) without additional nomenclature; only 1.2% used AE alone. Few publications used the terminology 'childhood eczema', 'flexural eczema', 'infantile eczema', 'atopic neurodermatitis', or 'Besnier's prurigo'. AD was rarely used until the late 1970s, after which it became the most commonly used of the three terms and continuously increased until 2015. Atopic eczema decreased between 2008 and 2015. Atopic dermatitis was the most commonly used term in studies across almost all publication types, languages, and journals.

CONCLUSION:
Atopic dermatitis is the most commonly used term and appears to be increasing in popularity. Given that eczema is a nonspecific term that describes the morphological appearance of several forms of dermatitis, we strongly suggest the use of a more specific term, AD, in publications, healthcare clinician training, and patient education. Support from researchers, reviewers, and editors is key to success.","The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers.

allergy and immunology,pediatric allergy,Treating asthma with omega-3 fatty acids: where is the evidence? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids. Given the interplay between pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, and the less pro-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, it has been thought that the latter could play a key role in treating or preventing asthma. The purpose was to systematically review the scientific-medical literature in order to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence for possible treatment effects of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma.

METHODS:
Medline, Premedline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Health, and, Dissertation Abstracts were searched to April 2003. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT's) of subjects of any age that used any foods or extracts containing omega-3 fatty acids as treatment or prevention for asthma. Data included all asthma related outcomes, potential covariates, characteristics of the study, design, population, intervention/exposure, comparators, and co interventions.

RESULTS:
Ten RCT's were found pertinent to the present report.

CONCLUSION:
Given the largely inconsistent picture within and across respiratory outcomes, it is impossible to determine whether or not omega-3 fatty acids are an efficacious adjuvant or monotherapy for children or adults. Based on this systematic review we recommend a large randomized controlled study of the effects of high-dose encapsulated omega-3 fatty acids on ventilatory and inflammatory measures of asthma controlling diet and other asthma risk factors. This review was limited because Meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to missing data; poorly or heterogeneously defined populations, interventions, intervention-comparator combinations, and outcomes. In addition, small sample sizes made it impossible to meaningfully assess the impact on clinical outcomes of co-variables. Last, few significant effects were found.","Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids.

Some studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators associated with asthma [1], and a randomized controlled trial involving 616 pregnant women found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of wheeze in high-risk children [2]. However, a case-control study found that the odds of asthma were increased in relation to intake of omega-3 fatty acids [3]. A review of existing literature suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-inflammatory properties and may modulate immune responses, but their effects are not strong [4]. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that maternal fish oil supplementation resulted in lower plasma IL-13 levels in neonates, suggesting potential immunomodulatory properties [5]. However, other reviews have highlighted that clinical data on the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in asthma has been inconclusive, with positive results in reducing airway hyperresponsiveness in nonatopic elite athletes with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction but not in other populations [7,15]. A nested case-control cross-sectional study found a significant association between the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of current asthma [13]. 

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in reducing some asthma symptoms, particularly in high-risk children and nonatopic elite athletes with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. However, results are mixed and further research is needed to conclusively establish the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma management.

Several review articles [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15] highlight the potential anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids, which could be beneficial in managing asthma. However, the evidence from clinical trials is inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis [4] found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy did not significantly reduce the risk of asthma in offspring, although some subgroup analyses suggested potential benefits. Another systematic review and meta-analysis [10] also suggested that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of wheeze/asthma in children, but not significantly reduce the incidence of childhood asthma. A systematic review [13] found a positive trend for omega-3 fatty acids and asthma/wheeze, but it did not reach statistical significance.

Some studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators associated with asthma [1], and a randomized controlled trial involving 616 pregnant women found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of wheeze in high-risk children [2]. However, a case-control study found that the odds of asthma were increased in relation to intake of omega-3 fatty acids [3]. A review of existing literature suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-inflammatory properties and may modulate immune responses, but their effects are not strong [4]. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that maternal fish oil supplementation resulted in lower plasma IL-13 levels in neonates, suggesting potential immunomodulatory properties [5]. However, other reviews have highlighted that clinical data on the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in asthma has been inconclusive, with positive results in reducing airway hyperresponsiveness in nonatopic elite athletes with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction but not in other populations [7,15]. A nested case-control cross-sectional study found a significant association between the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of current asthma [13]. 

"," Current evidence suggests potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in reducing some asthma symptoms, particularly in high-risk children and nonatopic elite athletes with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. However, results are mixed and further research is needed to conclusively establish the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma management.

"," The current body of literature presents mixed and inconclusive findings on the use of omega-3 fatty acids in treating asthma. Several review articles [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15] highlight the potential anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids, which could be beneficial in managing asthma. However, the evidence from clinical trials is inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis [4] found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy did not significantly reduce the risk of asthma in offspring, although some subgroup analyses suggested potential benefits. Another systematic review and meta-analysis [10] also suggested that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of wheeze/asthma in children, but not significantly reduce the incidence of childhood asthma. A systematic review [13] found a positive trend for omega-3 fatty acids and asthma/wheeze, but it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, some articles [7, 14] noted that while animal experiments and clinical trials in other inflammatory diseases have shown benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, trials in asthma have been inconsistent with no clear evidence of efficacy.

Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) is a popular supplement with potential cardiovascular benefits but a recent large-scale study found no evidence for using this substance to reduce cardiovascular events.

allergy and immunology,rhinitis and sinusitis,"Taste receptors in chronic rhinosinusitus, what is the evidence? A systematic review.","BACKGROUND:
Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Growing evidence suggests extraoral TRs as relevant biomarkers, but the current understanding is incomplete. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence of extraoral taste receptors in CRS.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus were reviewed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included studies of genotypic and phenotypic T2R/T1R status in CRS patients.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two studies with 3845 patients were included. Seventeen studies evaluated genotype and 10 evaluated taste phenotypes. Four of 6 studies examining the haplotype distribution of the T2R, TAS2R38, demonstrated increased AVI/AVI haplotype (""nontaster"") frequency in CRS. Meanwhile, 2 studies demonstrated decreased bitter sensitivity in CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), whereas 3 other studies reported decreased bitter sensitivity only in CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). Findings regarding sweet sensitivity were mixed. Three studies with cystic fibrosis patients (nÂ =Â 1393) were included. Studies investigating the association between clinical outcomes and TAS2R38 alleles were limited, but the nonfunctional combination of AVI/AVI was associated with increased utilization of sinus surgery and, in CRSsNP patients, with poorer improvement of symptoms postoperatively.

CONCLUSION:
Both genotypic and phenotypic assessments of T2Rs suggest a potential association with CRS, particularly CRSsNP. However, limited evidence and mixed conclusions cloud the role of T2Rs in CRS. Future investigations should aim to increase diverse populations, broaden institutional diversity, examine T1Rs, and utilize uniform assessments.","Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The role of taste receptors, specifically the TAS2R family, as potential biomarkers for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been explored in various studies. The ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), which is associated with specific genetic variations of the bitter taste receptor T2R38, has been found to correlate with increased disease severity in white CRS patients without polyps [1]. Taste receptors have been found in various locations throughout the body, including the respiratory tract, and their role as potential biomarkers for diseases like CRS has been suggested [2]. Basic science research suggests that T2R38 is activated by molecules secreted by gram-negative bacteria, leading to increased nitric oxide production, which enhances mucociliary clearance and kills bacteria [3]. A systematic review of 22 studies with 3,845 patients suggested a potential association between genotypic and phenotypic assessments of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) and CRS, particularly CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) [5]. A study with 123 CRS patients found that TAS2R38 genotype significantly correlated with surgical outcomes in patients without polyps [7]. Furthermore, all 25 human bitter taste receptors were found to be expressed in sinonasal tissue [8]. However, the evidence is limited and conclusions are mixed, with some studies finding no significant differences in taste receptor expression between CRS patients and controls [9].

There is some evidence suggesting that bitter taste receptors, specifically T2R38, may serve as potential biomarkers for chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly in patients without nasal polyps. However, the evidence is limited and conclusions are mixed, necessitating further research.

","The evidence for taste receptors as biomarkers for chronic rhinosinusitus is inconclusive. Studies have suggested that chronic rhinosinusitus is caused by multiple factors such as biofilms, bacterial antigens, fungal infections, or immune dysfunction. Symptoms can include congestion, rhinorrhea, facial pressure, hyposmia, and nasal obstruction, and treatment is often medical management, endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), or a combination of the two. The saccharin test is primarily used to measure the mucociliary clearance time, when a sweet taste should be perceived as cilia sweep the saccharin posteriorly. Animal studies have described histological changes in rhinitis medicamentosa including loss of nasociliary function, hyperplasia of goblet cells, edema, and metaplasia, however, human studies have been inconclusive regarding taste receptors as biomarkers for chronic rhinosinusitus.",0.7545492053031921,0.09333333333333332,0.15151515151515152,35.204803470643384,0.043668122270742356,0.7743520372489193,0.0,0.5672308451204158,0.2643086579120096,0.7461187839508057,0.10285714285714287,0.13793103448275862,32.25672234309325,0.0611353711790393,0.8196331521739131,0.0,0.5449597639868958,0.2571668813298205,0.7831664085388184,0.1111111111111111,0.1191969887076537,24.958052827669288,0.05467196819085487,1.0,0.0,0.5670854584070353,0.29342261341992465,0.7831433415412903,0.125,0.14231290322580642,28.22443669502687,0.06103896103896104,1.0,0.0,0.5748843010514975,0.29331848725596027,0.7863263487815857,0.10958904109589039,0.19704433497536944,36.94635178361302,0.056768558951965066,0.7509057971014492,0.0,0.6122129079885781,0.28577447626355884,0.7678645849227905,0.12377850162866448,0.1293950676666726,26.13614071472527,0.060824742268041236,1.0,0.0,0.5409268230672867,0.28531906531170054,0.7710989117622375,0.1391941391941392,0.14298256410256413,29.82369715034957,0.06790123456790123,1.0,0.0,0.5497603255106991,0.2867677830392902,0.7606116533279419,0.061538461538461535,0.1141552511415525,27.334269391288508,0.019650655021834062,0.8097826086956522,0.0,0.5888408287004991,0.2640103846399945,0.7941457629203796,0.12680115273775217,0.13560479985985807,26.39033934185761,0.07419898819561552,1.0,0.0,0.5786434067363407,0.3075339357162452,0.7966633439064026,0.13636363636363638,0.15007635071048422,30.33220237069291,0.08651911468812877,1.0,0.0,0.5875208223131811,0.310228286351823,0.7816211581230164,0.1037037037037037,0.18627450980392155,36.31847062745735,0.048034934497816595,0.8274456521739131,0.0,0.6274838344617324,0.2819472570644869,0.7938439249992371,0.13513513513513514,0.1732965551717058,32.126004124528826,0.07885304659498207,0.9671299390968509,0.0,0.5982832781133804,0.2958691478471593,0.7441059947013855,0.08256880733944955,0.1738945642241943,31.015480027757125,0.0706713780918728,1.0,0.0,0.5222304215525636,0.2624693135931009
anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is Femoral Nerve Block Superior to Fascia Iliac Block in Hip Surgery? Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of FNB compared with FICB are yet to be fully determined.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were systematically searched. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hip surgery were included. Postoperatively, the pain scores at different time points, narcotic requirements in 24âh, mean arterial pressure, spinal anesthesia (SA) time, patient satisfaction, and adverse effect rates between the two groups were extracted throughout the study.

RESULTS:
Fourteen RCTs including 1179 patients were included. Compared to the FICB, FNB decreased the VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and the incidence rate of some side effects (nausea, vomiting, and sedation) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, compared to the FICB, no significant difference was found in the FNB regarding the VAS scores postoperatively at any of the other time points (2âmin, 20âmin, 2âh, 24âh at movement, 48âh at rest, and 48âh at movement). Patients in both groups had similar narcotic needs after 24âh, mean arterial pressure, SA time, and patient satisfaction (<i>P</i> > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
FNB has more advantages in reducing VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest and the odds of some adverse effects. A better quality RCT is needed to properly compare FNB with FICB.","Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery.

","The Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) is indicated for surgeries on the anterior aspect of the thigh.

The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) is used to target articular branches of the femoral nerve to provide analgesia in the hip joint. Comparatively, the Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block can block the femoral, obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, which can provide prolonged pain relief in the hip, anterior and medial thigh area but is not sufficient to provide adequate analgesia in the hip joint. Therefore, the Femoral Nerve Block is likely to be more beneficial for hip surgery than a Fascia Iliaca Block.",0.7101651430130005,0.11176470588235295,0.13289126106234667,20.24073862778108,0.06263269639065817,1.0,0.0,0.5004225836132036,0.25058650665570387,0.7014355063438416,0.1095890410958904,0.14220183486238536,27.609837966493917,0.041237113402061855,0.8328654188948307,0.0,0.5021398414736209,0.23220823633945853,0.7218827605247498,0.09090909090909091,0.1483164517492937,23.689895854771343,0.06933333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.4786267996096926,0.24642762453373981,0.7237241864204407,0.09811320754716982,0.1618046085867352,25.80342120760783,0.0779816513761468,1.0,0.0,0.4837576571454857,0.24678326510271,0.6832156777381897,0.028571428571428574,0.061538461538461556,16.440049339865183,0.005154639175257732,0.8764705882352941,0.0,0.48531784772872927,0.2053099667335676,0.7404853105545044,0.09287925696594428,0.15223791909421913,22.414887720694743,0.06559139784946237,1.0,0.0,0.49901457581528275,0.260863519005244,0.7424382567405701,0.09966777408637874,0.1709204746022806,24.292445429941115,0.07349397590361446,1.0,0.0,0.5085480484824915,0.26303423923991354,0.683143675327301,0.0425531914893617,0.0748502994011976,16.577690473544987,0.005154639175257732,0.8720588235294118,0.0,0.48402688251091885,0.2069231943741116,0.7879863977432251,0.2466666666666667,0.26363988010755923,32.005085153671544,0.15432098765432098,1.0,0.0,0.5787718613778264,0.30428318953520894,0.7976528406143188,0.27819548872180455,0.3016766320927395,37.26486449795268,0.18693009118541035,1.0,0.0,0.605779910855221,0.3117710514000267,0.7155805826187134,0.06535947712418301,0.15227868281688076,23.048549194867913,0.018900343642611683,0.8437675070028012,0.0,0.5233658055464426,0.22884638701524287,0.7668637037277222,0.17490494296577946,0.2032391870432518,31.325678270915308,0.11295681063122924,1.0,0.0,0.5652540013674767,0.28495468954627423,0.7065655589103699,0.13186813186813187,0.155290849799277,22.876650163542394,0.06417910447761194,1.0,0.0,0.476402681449364,0.23698725164799397
anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is local anaesthesia a favourable approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation? A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing local and general anaesthesia.,"OBJECTIVES:
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the potential favourable effects of local anaesthesia plus sedation (LAS) compared with general anaesthesia (GA) in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

METHODS:
Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and the reference lists of eligible publications were screened for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies published between 1 January 2006 and 26 June 2016 that compare LAS to GA in an adult study population undergoing TAVI. We conducted study quality assessments using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and structured the review according to PRISMA. A meta-analysis calculating the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under the assumption of a random-effects model was performed. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the IÂ² statistic and Cochran's Q-test.

RESULTS:
After database screening, one RCT and 19 observational studies were included in the review. We found no differences between LAS and GA in terms of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and other endpoints that addressed safety and complication rates. LAS was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay and with lower rates of catecholamine administration and red blood cell transfusion. New pacemaker implantations occurred more frequently under LAS. The overall conversion rate from LAS to GA was 6.2%.

CONCLUSION:
For TAVI, both LAS and GA are feasible and safe. LAS may have some benefits such as increased haemodynamic stability and shorter hospital and ICU stays, but it does not impact 30-day mortality. Since there is a paucity of randomised trial data and the findings are mainly based on observational study data, this review should be considered as a hypothesis-generating article for subsequent RCTs that are required to confirm the potential favourable effects we detected for LAS.

Larger observational studies involving 125 and 2807 patients respectively, have shown that LA was associated with shorter procedure duration, hospital stay, and lower intraoperative requirements of catecholamines and volume expansion compared to general anesthesia (GA) [2, 13]. However, the frequency of postoperative complications and mortality rates were similar between the LA and GA groups [2, 13]. A meta-analysis of eligible studies also found no significant difference in all-cause mortality or complication rates between LA and GA groups, but LA was associated with a significantly shorter procedural duration and hospital stay [3]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,542 patients from seven observational studies showed that monitored anesthesia care (MAC) was associated with a shorter hospital stay and procedure time compared to GA, with no significant difference in 30-day mortality or cardiac-/procedure-related mortality [4]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,919 patients from 10 non-randomized studies found that the choice of anesthesia technique did not significantly affect the 30-day mortality rate or a wide variety of safety endpoints, but LA was associated with a shorter procedure time and reduced hospital length of stay compared to GA [9]. However, LA increased the risk of implantation of a permanent pacemaker and paravalvular leakage [9]. A retrospective cohort study of 174 patients who underwent a transcarotid TAVR found no significant difference in 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, 1-month clinical efficacy, and early safety between the LA and GA groups, but the GA group had a higher rate of periprocedural cerebrovascular events [7].

TL;DR: Available evidence suggests that local anesthesia is a feasible approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, with potential benefits including shorter procedure duration and hospital stay. However, the choice of anesthesia does not seem to significantly affect mortality or complication rates. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

TAVI is a minimally invasive procedure used to replace the aortic valve in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are considered high-risk or inoperable for traditional open-heart surgery. Local anesthesia involves numbing the specific area where the procedure is performed, allowing the patient to remain awake and conscious during the procedure. This approach has several advantages, including reduced risk of complications associated with general anesthesia, shorter recovery time, and potential cost savings. However, the decision to use local anesthesia for TAVI depends on various factors, including patient preference, procedural complexity, and the expertise of the medical team. It is important for the medical team to carefully evaluate each patient's individual circumstances and determine the most appropriate anesthesia approach for TAVI.","The papers suggest that local anesthesia is a feasible and safe approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in certain patients. Rajagopal 2014 and Azmoun 2014 both report successful TAVI procedures using a transcarotid approach under local anesthesia.

"," Current evidence suggests that local anesthesia may be a favorable approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, associated with shorter procedure times and hospital stays, but more randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

","Local anaesthesia is not recommended for transcatheter aortic valve implantation due to the increased risk of hypotension and cardiac complications. Low dose injections of spinal opioids may be a viable option for mild or moderate valvular heart disease patients, however it should be avoided in patients with severe aortic stenosis due to an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation. Similarly, segmental epidural anaesthesia should be approached with caution as hypotension may not be tolerated in this population. For general anaesthesia, it is best to avoid depression of the left ventricle, and an opioid-based induction may be beneficial. All three surgical approaches to the aortic valve (mini-thoracotomy, minimally thoracoscopic approach, and percutaneous approach) require general anaesthesia, transesophageal echocardiogram, and full cardiac monitoring, and the operating room must be fully prepared in the same way as when a conventional aortic valve surgery is about to be performed.",0.7414584755897522,0.10970464135021096,0.11236718275652703,23.67921804186375,0.04208754208754209,1.0,0.0,0.5085945261473005,0.2597244400347964,0.7548443675041199,0.12154696132596686,0.14469453376205788,30.03494618269855,0.0502283105022831,0.8228918875938429,0.0,0.5348015257290432,0.26141643082359,0.787162184715271,0.15894039735099338,0.1230321150285579,18.384793003332124,0.06770186335403727,1.0,0.0,0.5518179431838809,0.30592442183429425,0.7923902869224548,0.17412935323383086,0.13881610057502053,20.893359256433367,0.07474600870827286,1.0,0.0,0.5633905512079889,0.30916566768246107,0.7886227965354919,0.13333333333333336,0.27552055408168713,39.401013481747924,0.06621004566210045,0.8243474337991523,0.0,0.6118007930926979,0.28739652165660057,0.770892322063446,0.1301775147928994,0.13136936848151953,21.072801370315823,0.05596330275229358,1.0,0.0,0.5267126362589074,0.2877528560249239,0.7772965431213379,0.13559322033898305,0.1631104166982012,24.76065585528294,0.0651685393258427,1.0,0.0,0.5396272379360841,0.2919994572150305,0.7691265344619751,0.09859154929577466,0.18304431599229284,33.096719617848656,0.0410958904109589,0.8136040968487778,0.0,0.5904276535979339,0.2708067389199719,0.7591515183448792,0.14647887323943662,0.15343441826379262,22.22083612760729,0.070902394106814,1.0,0.0,0.505043735344645,0.2803680052162246,0.7638359069824219,0.13166144200626959,0.1981587174984261,24.98825058443024,0.07917570498915401,1.0,0.0,0.5117423459643223,0.2835717941365833,0.7679802179336548,0.11851851851851852,0.2168949771689498,35.5583852324394,0.04794520547945205,0.8123762762060635,0.0,0.5873683214187622,0.2702939958838611,0.7537081837654114,0.12244897959183673,0.1545433177557172,28.543076990796894,0.07077625570776255,0.8404674975869738,0.0,0.5390855870285972,0.2659823911397454,0.7335968613624573,0.10526315789473684,0.10355987055016182,22.53428612852108,0.04100946372239748,1.0,0.0,0.500664201796864,0.25437783639825984
cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,Heart failure in pregnancy: what is the long-term impact of pregnancy on cardiac function? A tertiary care centre experience and systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Women with cardiomyopathy (CM) are often advised against pregnancy due to risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, the impact of CM subtype on maternal MACE is not understood, and so we sought to evaluate the influence of CM phenotype on maternal outcomes, as well as the effect on immediate and late left ventricular function.

METHODS:
We evaluated all pregnant women in our high-risk maternal cardiovascular programme (2009-2019). Composite maternal MACE included: death, inotrope use, left ventricular assist device, orthotopic heart transplant and/or escalation in transplant listing status, acute decompensated heart failure and sustained ventricular arrhythmia.

RESULTS:
Among 875 women followed, 32 had CM (29Â±7 years old, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 41%Â±12%): 3 ischaemic CM (ICM), 10 peripartum CM (PPCM) and 19 non-ICM (NICM). MACE events occurred in 6 (18%) women (PPCM: 2 (33%), NICM: 4 (67%)). There was no difference in LVEF at baseline, however, women with MACE had significantly lower LVEF both early (LVEF: 27Â±5% vs . 41Â±2%, p<0.05) and late post partum (LVEF: 28Â±5% vs . 44Â±2%, p<0.01).

CONCLUSIONS:
In this contemporary cohort of women with CM, maternal MACE rates were lower than previously reported, and were less common in PPCM as compared with ICM and NICM. Heart function in women with MACE was negatively impacted immediately after delivery and in late postpartum follow-up, suggesting that pregnancy itself likely has influence on future left ventricular function in women with underlying CM.","Women with cardiomyopathy (CM) are often advised against pregnancy due to risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Pregnancy can negatively impact future left ventricular function in women with cardiomyopathy subtypes, with major adverse cardiovascular events occurring in 18% of women with cardiomyopathy [1]. Preeclampsia is consistently associated with higher blood pressure and body mass index as early as 4-10 years of age and is linked to long-term cardiovascular complications in infants and children [2,3]. The antiangiogenic state present in preeclampsia is related to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors later in life [5]. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) can impair cardiac function, with recovery of cardiac function influencing long-term prognosis [6,8,15,20]. Obesity during pregnancy has been linked to significant changes in cardiac function and structure [9]. Women with a history of preeclampsia often exhibit increased diastolic dysfunction, increased left ventricular mass index, and concentric hypertrophy [10,11,12]. Furthermore, the number of pregnancies in women with LMNA+ variants does not seem to have an impact on long-term cardiac function [17]. However, lactation may have long-term benefits on cardiac function and adiposity [13]. 

TL;DR: Pregnancy can have varied long-term impacts on cardiac function, with conditions such as cardiomyopathy, preeclampsia, and obesity exacerbating negative outcomes, while factors like lactation may have beneficial effects. However, the extent of these impacts can be influenced by individual health factors and genetic variants.

During pregnancy, the body undergoes significant physiological changes, including an increase in blood volume and cardiac output to support the growing fetus. This can lead to structural changes in the heart, such as a slight increase in the size of the heart chambers and a mild increase in wall thickness.

Most of these changes usually revert to normal within a year after delivery. However, in some cases, these changes may persist and can potentially lead to long-term cardiac issues. For instance, pregnancy can unmask a predisposition to heart disease, particularly in women who experience complications such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. These conditions can increase a woman's risk of developing heart disease later in life.

Moreover, multiple pregnancies can result in cumulative changes to the heart and blood vessels, which may increase the risk of developing heart disease in the future. It's also important to note that the risk of heart disease can be influenced by other factors such as age, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition.

Therefore, while pregnancy can have a long-term impact on cardiac function, the extent of this impact can vary greatly among individuals. Regular check-ups and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help manage these risks.","During pregnancy, the cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes to accommodate the growing fetus. These changes include an increase in blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate. The heart also undergoes structural adaptations, such as an increase in left ventricular mass and dilation of the heart chambers.

In the long term, pregnancy has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on cardiac function. Some studies have suggested that pregnancy may have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases later in life. This may be due to the physiological adaptations that occur during pregnancy, such as improved endothelial function and increased cardiac reserve.

However, pregnancy can also unmask or exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions. Women with pre-existing heart conditions may experience worsening symptoms or complications during pregnancy. Additionally, certain pregnancy-related conditions, such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes, can have negative effects on cardiac function.

Overall, the long-term impact of pregnancy on cardiac function can vary depending on individual factors and pre-existing conditions. It is important for women to receive appropriate prenatal care and for healthcare providers to closely monitor cardiac function during and after pregnancy to ensure the best outcomes for both the mother and the baby.","The papers suggest that pregnancy can have both immediate and long-term impacts on cardiac function. Dodeja 2021 found that women with cardiomyopathy had lower left ventricular ejection fraction both early and late postpartum, suggesting that pregnancy can negatively impact future left ventricular function in women with underlying cardiomyopathy. Uebing 2010 found no deleterious midterm effects of pregnancy on clinical status and right and left ventricular function in women with heart disease, but pregnancy was associated with a persisting increase in subpulmonary ventricular size in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Khodiguian 1996 found that pregnancy/control versus pregnancy/postpartum studies yield statistically different results, suggesting that standardized methodologies are needed to evaluate physiological processes in pregnancy. Finally, Clapp 1997 found that cardiovascular adaptations to the initial pregnancy begin early, persist postpartum, and appear to be enhanced by a subsequent pregnancy, suggesting that pregnancy can have long-term impacts on cardiovascular function."," Pregnancy induces substantial physiological changes in the cardiovascular system, including alterations in blood volume, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, vascular resistance, and colloid osmotic pressure [3].

Pregnancy-related complications such as pre-eclampsia and peripartum cardiomyopathy can lead to cardiovascular diseases, though the long-term effects are still being evaluated [10]. A retrospective cohort study on Turner syndrome patients found that aortic diameters increased during pregnancy, although no cases of aortic dissection were reported during or after pregnancy [2]. A study on obese pregnant women found that they had significantly higher systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and left ventricular mass index compared to controls, suggesting potential maladaptive cardiac responses to volume overload [9]. A murine study suggested that lactation could have long-term benefits for cardiovascular health [7]. However, these findings need to be interpreted cautiously due to potential biases in the studies, lack of control groups in some cases, and the use of animal models which may not fully replicate human physiology.

"," Pregnancy can potentially impact long-term cardiac function, particularly in the presence of complications like pre-eclampsia or conditions like obesity, but more research is needed to fully understand these effects.

"," The long-term impact of pregnancy on cardiac function appears to be multifaceted, with several factors influencing outcomes. Pregnancy can negatively impact future left ventricular function in women with cardiomyopathy subtypes, with major adverse cardiovascular events occurring in 18% of women with cardiomyopathy [1]. Preeclampsia is consistently associated with higher blood pressure and body mass index as early as 4-10 years of age and is linked to long-term cardiovascular complications in infants and children [2,3]. The antiangiogenic state present in preeclampsia is related to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors later in life [5]. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) can impair cardiac function, with recovery of cardiac function influencing long-term prognosis [6,8,15,20]. Obesity during pregnancy has been linked to significant changes in cardiac function and structure [9]. Women with a history of preeclampsia often exhibit increased diastolic dysfunction, increased left ventricular mass index, and concentric hypertrophy [10,11,12]. Furthermore, the number of pregnancies in women with LMNA+ variants does not seem to have an impact on long-term cardiac function [17]. However, lactation may have long-term benefits on cardiac function and adiposity [13]. 

"," Pregnancy can have varied long-term impacts on cardiac function, with conditions such as cardiomyopathy, preeclampsia, and obesity exacerbating negative outcomes, while factors like lactation may have beneficial effects. However, the extent of these impacts can be influenced by individual health factors and genetic variants.

","The long-term impact of pregnancy on cardiac function includes structural and hemodynamic changes. These changes cause an increase in ventricular wall mass and end-diastolic volumes with a resulting increase in cardiac output during pregnancy. Immediately postpartum, blood volume contracts and preload increases, leading to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. This is followed by a rapid decline in cardiac output back to pre-labor levels and a return to pre-pregnant pressures two weeks postpartum. As the maternal heart undergoes significant changes during pregnancy, the risk of peripartum cardiomyopathy is increased and can exacerbate pre-existing heart diseases. Additionally, decreases in systemic vascular resistance, combined with aortic stenosis can lead to decreased diastolic pressures that may not be adequate to provide coronary perfusion pressure to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand from a thickened ventricular wall. This can ultimately lead to left ventricular heart failure.",0.7842081189155579,0.09053497942386832,0.06491965244229736,10.098716792889546,0.021158129175946547,1.0,0.0,0.5107454463723116,0.2870744231506279,0.7669280767440796,0.08064516129032258,0.05592923213980077,10.572741685545667,0.018518518518518517,1.0,0.0,0.4792329906611829,0.2669633454943643,0.7360630631446838,0.07482993197278912,0.03550855445311251,7.397651474439286,0.011811023622047244,1.0,0.0,0.4279062046539186,0.24902829207304303,0.7397968173027039,0.07373271889400923,0.04664720045079659,9.65604698788141,0.013859275053304905,1.0,0.0,0.44132656350357985,0.2529313160039176,0.7849712371826172,0.10909090909090909,0.0849673202614379,17.761133577733563,0.02903225806451613,1.0,0.0,0.5206203987723903,0.2686758835908365,0.7720175385475159,0.08144796380090497,0.05779067551920739,11.411099350836336,0.022004889975550123,1.0,0.0,0.47267961419290966,0.2698742992386318,0.781133770942688,0.0851063829787234,0.06330456455739834,12.772785249183283,0.02373887240356083,1.0,0.0,0.48522896233659524,0.27473834890271714,0.7845810651779175,0.0909090909090909,0.10802469135802469,30.948628250883896,0.028985507246376812,0.7848101265822784,0.0,0.5302259218998444,0.27166126871838403,0.7658827304840088,0.09523809523809523,0.05798409390091811,10.584242754945667,0.034195933456561925,1.0,0.0,0.46849748952973186,0.27442722789933427,0.7718652486801147,0.11504424778761063,0.08142307141473111,12.95626821464866,0.042923433874709975,1.0,0.0,0.48262015426981036,0.2814045649849992,0.7792648077011108,0.1,0.11111111111111113,25.80499828871403,0.030303030303030304,1.0,0.0,0.5003342907875776,0.2593228420240006,0.8365711569786072,0.18181818181818182,0.11868914985446154,17.275253795952516,0.08461538461538462,1.0,0.0,0.5871058722057253,0.32810078865784525,0.7891898155212402,0.10869565217391303,0.07234867969821673,13.03227159776122,0.025889967637540454,1.0,0.0,0.5227304243329746,0.2828517442044912
cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,Are interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors effective? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. However, many individuals are unaware of their CVD risk factors. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of existing intervention strategies to increase uptake of CVD risk factors screening.

METHODS:
A systematic search was conducted through Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additional articles were located through cross-checking of the references list and bibliography citations of the included studies and previous review papers. We included intervention studies with controlled or baseline comparison groups that were conducted in primary care practices or the community, targeted at adult populations (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials with controlled groups and pre- and post-intervention studies). The interventions were targeted either at individuals, communities, health care professionals or the health-care system. The main outcome of interest was the relative risk (RR) of screening uptake rates due to the intervention.

RESULTS:
We included 21 studies in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias for randomization was low to medium in the randomized controlled trials, except for one, and high in the non-randomized trials. Two analyses were performed; optimistic (using the highest effect sizes) and pessimistic (using the lowest effect sizes). Overall, interventions were shown to increase the uptake of screening for CVD risk factors (RR 1.443; 95% CI 1.264 to 1.648 for pessimistic analysis and RR 1.680; 95% CI 1.420 to 1.988 for optimistic analysis). Effective interventions that increased screening participation included: use of physician reminders (RR ranged between 1.392; 95% CI 1.192 to 1.625, and 1.471; 95% CI 1.304 to 1.660), use of dedicated personnel (RR ranged between 1.510; 95% CI 1.014 to 2.247, and 2.536; 95% CI 1.297 to 4.960) and provision of financial incentives for screening (RR 1.462; 95% CI 1.068 to 2.000). Meta-regression analysis showed that the effect of CVD risk factors screening uptake was not associated with study design, types of population nor types of interventions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Interventions using physician reminders, using dedicated personnel to deliver screening, and provision of financial incentives were found to be effective in increasing CVD risk factors screening uptake.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally.

Mobile health tools such as a Blood Pressure Management Application (BPMAP) have been developed to help manage hypertension, a key CVD risk factor [1]. Other studies have found that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a higher prevalence of CVD and major cardiovascular risk factors compared to the non-COPD population [2]. Dietary interventions, such as low-carbohydrate diets, have been found to decrease body weight and improve cardiovascular risk factors [3]. Interventions that combine behavioral counseling, exercise, and nutrition have been found to be more effective in improving cardiovascular health compared to interventions focused on only one of these factors [5]. Active call interventions have been found to be effective in identifying individuals with hyperglycemia and high blood pressure and offering suitable checking or CVD prevention programs [8]. Interventions involving pharmacists have also been shown to improve control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking cessation [15]. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can be influenced by factors such as patient health literacy and adherence to treatment [17].

TL;DR: Interventions can be effective in increasing the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors, but their effectiveness can vary depending on the type of intervention and the population targeted.

A meta-analysis involving over 10 million individuals demonstrated that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that screening and appropriate management of prediabetes could contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease [6]. A large cohort study with over 46,000 participants with type 2 diabetes showed that recent diabetes screening has changed the cardiovascular risk profile of people with diabetes, with many having low cardiovascular risk [5].

These interventions may include health education, reminders, incentives, and changes in the healthcare system to make screening more accessible. Studies have shown that these interventions can lead to increased screening rates, early detection, and better management of cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can vary depending on the specific population and setting.","Yes, interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors have been found to be effective. Several studies have shown that targeted interventions, such as educational campaigns, reminders, and incentives, can significantly increase the number of individuals who undergo screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors. These interventions have been shown to improve early detection and management of risk factors, leading to better outcomes and reduced cardiovascular disease burden.","The papers suggest that interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors can be effective. Cheong 2017 found that interventions such as physician reminders, dedicated personnel, and financial incentives were effective in increasing CVD risk factors screening uptake. Goldfarb 2015 found that screening strategies targeting family members, particularly when led by a health care professional, achieved a high participation rate. Wee 2013 found that a 6-month intervention program improved participation in CVD health screening in a low-income population. However, Holland 2013 found mixed evidence about the benefits of different intervention designs and strategies, suggesting that interventions must take into account effective health behavior change mechanisms and monitor delivery by trained professionals. Overall, the papers suggest that interventions can be effective in increasing the uptake of screening for CVD risk factors, but the most effective strategies may depend on the specific context and population being targeted."," The effectiveness of interventions for increasing the uptake of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor screening varies depending on the type of intervention and the population targeted. Mobile health tools such as a Blood Pressure Management Application (BPMAP) have been developed to help manage hypertension, a key CVD risk factor [1]. Other studies have found that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a higher prevalence of CVD and major cardiovascular risk factors compared to the non-COPD population [2]. Dietary interventions, such as low-carbohydrate diets, have been found to decrease body weight and improve cardiovascular risk factors [3]. Interventions that combine behavioral counseling, exercise, and nutrition have been found to be more effective in improving cardiovascular health compared to interventions focused on only one of these factors [5]. Active call interventions have been found to be effective in identifying individuals with hyperglycemia and high blood pressure and offering suitable checking or CVD prevention programs [8]. Interventions involving pharmacists have also been shown to improve control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking cessation [15]. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can be influenced by factors such as patient health literacy and adherence to treatment [17].

"," Interventions can be effective in increasing the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors, but their effectiveness can vary depending on the type of intervention and the population targeted.

"," Interventions aimed at increasing the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors appear to be effective based on the evidence from several studies. Telehealth exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation was found to be more effective than usual care in improving physical activity level, exercise adherence, diastolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) [1]. A meta-analysis involving over 10 million individuals demonstrated that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that screening and appropriate management of prediabetes could contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease [6]. A large cohort study with over 46,000 participants with type 2 diabetes showed that recent diabetes screening has changed the cardiovascular risk profile of people with diabetes, with many having low cardiovascular risk [5]. The study suggested that this has implications for the appropriate management and targeting of medications in this population. Reviews also highlighted the importance of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors in various populations, including low- and middle-income countries and refugees [4,7,8].

"," Yes, interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors appear to be effective based on the current evidence, although the strength of the evidence varies and further research is needed in some areas.

"," The systematic review and meta-analysis by Kearney et al. [1] provides strong evidence that interventions such as physician reminders, dedicated personnel, and financial incentives can effectively increase the uptake of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor screening. The study included 21 studies and demonstrated a low to medium risk of bias in the randomized controlled trials included. A study by Pylypchuk et al. [4] with a large sample size of 46,652 participants, showed the importance of accurate cardiovascular risk prediction in the management and targeting of preventive medications in patients with screen-detected diabetes. Additionally, a meta-analysis by Vas et al. [6] involving 10,069,955 individuals from 129 studies showed that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of CVD, and thus, screening and appropriate management of prediabetes could contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.

"," Evidence suggests that interventions, such as physician reminders, dedicated personnel, and financial incentives, are effective in increasing the uptake of cardiovascular disease risk factor screening [1].

","Interventions to increase the uptake of screening and modify cardiovascular disease risk factors have been proven effective. A study documented a substantial reduction in cardiac events and mortality, when optimal risk factor profiles were achieved in two-thirds of patients. This was supported by an interprofessional team comprised of pharmacists, nurses and a variety of physicians, which led to a 76% reduction in all-cause mortality associated with CAD. Risk factor and lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes, increased activity level and smoking cessation, have also been shown to have beneficial outcomes in people who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome. Patient education and referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program are crucial factors for effective risk factor management.",0.7383525967597961,0.17427385892116184,0.3023655744591472,42.18095301878182,0.09833795013850416,0.7990609303341342,0.0,0.657712252401724,0.2554068051891123,0.7266204953193665,0.18181818181818185,0.31838067841304085,45.09023408482798,0.09279778393351801,0.7759074033631798,0.0,0.6310378477853887,0.2512783961309677,0.742467999458313,0.14572864321608042,0.16969135516428982,26.864641714105673,0.0951035781544256,1.0,0.0,0.5617505509014192,0.26760396596652986,0.7322309613227844,0.13114754098360656,0.17623965115095616,28.60703897994456,0.09259259259259259,1.0,0.0,0.5565102587180927,0.2628751550194294,0.7068005204200745,0.16,0.30743066457352175,36.747565132821,0.04709141274238227,0.8246887966804979,0.0,0.6555360239563566,0.22449967664195228,0.7446308732032776,0.16062176165803108,0.17761174111264996,29.162756040301314,0.1023454157782516,1.0,0.0,0.5475865070854787,0.26490105783315954,0.7348300814628601,0.1729106628242075,0.17769531650512546,30.72436205555298,0.09973753280839895,1.0,0.0,0.544324459483445,0.2619394695704073,0.7016120553016663,0.13526570048309178,0.22092046695221304,31.19064811692347,0.055401662049861494,0.8257261410788381,0.0,0.5919943393730536,0.21998854424456896,0.7637515068054199,0.1946902654867257,0.2584195707525667,39.58816515511476,0.12010443864229765,1.0,0.0,0.5723033384724996,0.2793244435230962,0.7510210871696472,0.19935691318327972,0.22646481911865385,38.027117404244656,0.09833795013850416,0.8227303404489327,0.0,0.5505563454337852,0.26849640967263744,0.7392973303794861,0.17346938775510207,0.38482877784514913,40.149628078677296,0.04709141274238227,0.8747380593771766,0.0,0.6749374534402575,0.250430643486114,0.7555387020111084,0.1863354037267081,0.2738474129806812,42.44943153838076,0.1703601108033241,0.8873960410267464,0.0,0.6265904641612459,0.2744542398003249,0.7182754278182983,0.13194444444444442,0.18744978568428095,36.68319793271964,0.0817174515235457,0.7854295118733042,0.0,0.5418315335280366,0.2441741715901599
cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,A systematic review of PET and PET/CT in oncology: a way to personalize cancer treatment in a cost-effective manner?,"BACKGROUND:
A number of diagnostic tests are required for the detection and management of cancer. Most imaging modalities such as computerized tomography (CT) are anatomical. However, positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional diagnostic imaging technique using compounds labelled with positron-emitting radioisotopes to measure cell metabolism. It has been a useful tool in studying soft tissues such as the brain, cardiovascular system, and cancer. The aim of this systematic review is to critically summarize the health economic evidence of oncologic PET in the literature.

METHODS:
Eight electronic databases were searched from 2005 until February 2010 to identify economic evaluation studies not included in previous Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports. Only full health economic evaluations in English, French, or German were considered for inclusion. Economic evaluations were appraised using published quality criteria for assessing the quality of decision-analytic models. Given the variety of methods used in the health economic evaluations, the economic evidence has been summarized in qualitative form.

RESULTS:
From this new search, 14 publications were identified that met the inclusion criteria. All publications were decision-analytic models and evaluated PET using Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (FDG-PET). Eight publications were cost-effectiveness analyses; six were cost-utility analyses. The studies were from Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the base case analyses of these studies, cost-effectiveness results ranged from dominated to dominant. The methodology of the economic evaluations was of varying quality. Cost-effectiveness was primarily influenced by the cost of PET, the specificity of PET, and the risk of malignancy.

CONCLUSIONS:
Owing to improved care and less exposure to ineffective treatments, personalized medicine using PET may be cost-effective. However, the strongest evidence for the cost-effectiveness of PET is still in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Management decisions relating to the assessment of treatment response or radiotherapy treatment planning require further research to show the impact of PET on patient management and its cost-effectiveness. Because of the potential for increased patient throughput and the possible greater accuracy, the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT may be superior to that of PET. Only four studies of the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT were found in this review, and this is clearly an area for future research.","A number of diagnostic tests are required for the detection and management of cancer.

cardiovascular medicine,acute coronary syndromes,Could platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio be a predictor for contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with acute coronary syndrome?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is acute renal failure observed after administration of iodinated contrast media during angiographic or other medical procedures. In recent years, many studies have focused on biomarkers that recognize CIN and/or predict its development in advance. One of the many biomarkers studied is the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation between PLR level and CIN.

METHODS:
Relevant studies were searched in PUBMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science until September 15, 2018. Case-control studies reporting admission PLR levels in CIN and non-CIN group in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the association between PLR level and CIN using a random-effect model.

RESULTS:
Six relevant studies involving a total of 10452 ACS patients (9720 non-CIN controls and 732 CIN patients) met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of 6 case-control studies showed that PLR levels were significantly higher in CIN group than those in non-CIN group (WMDâ=â33.343, 95%CIâ=â18.863 to 47.823, P < .001, Iâ=â88.0%).

CONCLUSION:
For patients with ACS after contrast administration, our meta-analysis shows that on-admission PLR levels in CIN group are significantly higher than those of non-CIN group. However, large and matched cohort studies are needed to validate these findings and assess whether there is a real connection or just an association.","Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is acute renal failure observed after administration of iodinated contrast media during angiographic or other medical procedures.

In contrast, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10,452 patients found significantly higher PLR levels in CIN patients [3]. A retrospective study of 426 patients found that baseline PLR was significantly higher in CIN patients and was an independent predictor of CIN along with admission creatinine [4]. Similarly, a retrospective study of 488 patients found higher PLR levels in CIN patients and identified PLR as an independent predictor of CIN [5]. 

"," The evidence regarding the role of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictor for contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with acute coronary syndrome is mixed, with some studies supporting its predictive role [1,3,4,5] and others not [2]. Further research is needed to clarify these findings.

","Through cohort studies, the online calculator risk predictor (http://bmc2.org/calculators/cin) has been developed to predict the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy before undergoing a procedure. It is found that the prevalence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, while low osmolar contrast media usage decreases the risk. Various variables like infarct size, AST, ALT, CRP, and LDH levels, proteinuria and hematuria, and WBC count positively correlate with acute kidney injury. It is reported that beta-2-microglobulin levels less than 2.8 mg/L have a 100% negative predictive value and when the estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 45ml/min per 1.73 m2, CIN risk is increased. A history of contrast administration prior to presentation is observed in most cases. As to whether platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio can be a predictor for contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there is insufficient evidence as of now.",0.8066335916519165,0.1761006289308176,0.1840180516651105,34.215377404544064,0.09326424870466321,1.0,0.0,0.5897933015823364,0.3013353017353343,0.7989543080329895,0.21875000000000003,0.30490472125605717,35.59183815114056,0.11702127659574468,0.8741874527588813,0.0,0.5944315952413223,0.30166680007899255,0.7733418345451355,0.12698412698412698,0.1423860830854393,21.75748594693342,0.06419753086419754,1.0,0.0,0.513339020391376,0.29128966908264214,0.7817113995552063,0.15023474178403756,0.13466024526642092,24.94059078493843,0.06070287539936102,1.0,0.0,0.5257094638473397,0.2891939933476247,0.7661939263343811,0.1651376146788991,0.29911586216517855,35.602131502223735,0.09219858156028368,0.7500629881582263,0.0,0.5474212007789776,0.27047390077627564,0.7576584219932556,0.140625,0.10278987226842201,19.85027307453562,0.04513064133016627,1.0,0.0,0.49678194813856774,0.27560861041206336,0.7615674734115601,0.16513761467889906,0.1125421877308453,23.060996550075348,0.05102040816326531,1.0,0.0,0.5061505201583107,0.2777142479741285,0.7569800019264221,0.0925925925925926,0.16883116883116883,32.83715570419976,0.03900709219858156,0.8270975056689343,0.0,0.5279670042487291,0.2562949312207843,0.7696064710617065,0.14388489208633093,0.1025099734690774,20.68031293060929,0.06043956043956044,1.0,0.0,0.5140712532171836,0.2867563082071424,0.7800091505050659,0.17543859649122806,0.1055236594996977,24.056942018656507,0.0673352435530086,1.0,0.0,0.543068902026261,0.29332968737183296,0.7499846816062927,0.13333333333333333,0.20823140900195694,32.34784215181723,0.06382978723404255,0.787166328519712,0.0,0.4979990166094568,0.2528353684994385,0.7584537863731384,0.14746543778801843,0.11570933212724256,18.475707326072634,0.042071197411003236,1.0,0.0,0.5153646377133735,0.27212859808124024,0.7504283785820007,0.08658008658008659,0.12260450160771705,20.040115033626613,0.04366197183098591,1.0,0.0,0.475698714251401,0.26470521141397696
cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Can acupuncture reverse oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage in animal models of vascular dementia?: A preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Vascular dementia is a cognitive dysfunction syndrome caused by cerebral vascular factors such as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The effect of acupuncture on vascular dementia models is ambiguous, and there is controversy about whether acupuncture has a placebo effect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the most essential mechanisms in preclinical studies of vascular dementia. However, there is no meta-analysis on the mechanism of vascular dementia in animal models. It is necessary to explore the efficacy of acupuncture through Meta-analysis of preclinical studies.

METHODS:
Three major databases, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science (including medline), were searched in English until December 2022.The quality of the including literature was assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Review Manager 5.3 was used to statistically summarize the included studies and the statistical effect values were expressed by SMD. The outcomes included: behavioral tests (escape latency, number of crossings), pathological sections (Nissl and TUNEL staining), oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX) and neuroinflammatory factors (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6).

RESULTS:
A total of 31 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the escape latency, the contents of ROS, MDA, IL-1Î², and IL-6 were decreased, and the contents of SOD and Nissl-positive neurons were increased in the acupuncture group as compared with the non-group (Pâ<â.05). Compared with the impaired group, the acupuncture group also had the above advantages (Pâ<â.05). In addition, the acupuncture group also increased the number of crossings and GSH-PX content, and decreased the expression of TUNEL-positive neurons and TNF-Î± (Pâ<â.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
From behavioral tests to slices and pathological markers in animal models of vascular dementia, it can be proved that acupuncture is effective in targeting oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage, and acupuncture is not a placebo effect. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to the gap between animal experiments and clinical applications.","Vascular dementia is a cognitive dysfunction syndrome caused by cerebral vascular factors such as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.

While there is no definitive evidence that any of these medications can successfully reverse oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage in animal models of vascular dementia, further research is being conducted to assess the efficacy of these treatments and whether they can provide neuroprotection in humans.",0.8615918159484863,0.2833333333333333,0.32844275946704066,39.33946391386121,0.17482517482517482,0.917287488061127,0.0,0.7130085293282854,0.352308378310069,0.858102560043335,0.2553191489361702,0.4044107183515483,46.409005972873715,0.2018348623853211,0.6819484240687679,0.0,0.7056640122757584,0.348650976072805,0.7799023985862732,0.13533834586466165,0.10999812769144356,16.978216154951735,0.06289308176100629,1.0,0.0,0.5184461563054857,0.2915071415278436,0.774872899055481,0.1517857142857143,0.11218249136966657,20.453878038947465,0.06135770234986945,1.0,0.0,0.5067096508883097,0.28826788599676423,0.8571431040763855,0.24175824175824176,0.3947564935757658,47.14328088797552,0.17889908256880735,0.6596725081064574,0.0,0.7138191722986991,0.3494189359598118,0.7950581908226013,0.12698412698412698,0.1109139307897072,16.49514511456417,0.05161290322580645,1.0,0.0,0.5568362527693327,0.3009500553285421,0.7973994016647339,0.13574660633484162,0.12696873073889575,19.158331587513587,0.056962025316455694,1.0,0.0,0.553102544234956,0.30169280675514093,0.8680877089500427,0.275,0.38184079601990056,48.98103989884973,0.13302752293577982,0.6217765042979942,0.0,0.7641978888284593,0.35620161525620786,0.7833279371261597,0.13380281690140844,0.08929111206265294,15.008066334086312,0.05315315315315315,1.0,0.0,0.5583654802264716,0.30139303081921126,0.7782565951347351,0.14173228346456693,0.08949825544252789,16.771936496940107,0.05646817248459959,1.0,0.0,0.554977188269857,0.2972039616293888,0.8670792579650879,0.27848101265822783,0.37584647716899827,48.79563204189446,0.12844036697247707,0.6246418338108882,0.0,0.7641235182924968,0.35576548801452257,0.8364647030830383,0.24000000000000002,0.19850655493985672,26.06680246583289,0.122568093385214,1.0,0.0,0.6409584040825184,0.32849636890447514,0.7818204164505005,0.23225806451612904,0.1771565415745827,26.20685839144578,0.1111111111111111,1.0,0.0,0.5415913094147086,0.28847313397218327
cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,A systematic review of the Woven EndoBridge device-do findings in pre-clinical animal models compare to clinical results?,"BACKGROUND:
The Woven Endobridge (WEB) is designed to treat intracranial wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, preventing subarachnoid hemorrhage. The translational value of animal models used for WEB device testing is unknown. With this systematic review, we aim to identify the existing animal models used in testing the WEB device and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes to those of prospective clinical studies.

METHODS:
This study was funded by ZonMw: project number 114024133. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed and in EMBASE via the Ovid interface. The following exclusion criteria were used: 1) not an original full-length research paper, 2) not an in vivo animal study or a human study, 3) no WEB implantation, 4) if in humans: not a prospective study. The SYRCLE risk of bias tool (animal studies) and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for cohort studies (clinical studies) were used to assess risks of bias. A narrative synthesis was performed.

RESULTS:
Six animal studies and 17 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria. The rabbit elastase aneurysm model was the only animal model used to assess WEB device performance. Safety outcomes were never reported in animal studies. Efficacy outcomes were more heterogeneous in animal studies than in clinical studies, which could be due to limited external validity of the animal models in terms of aneurysm induction and dimensions. Both animal and clinical studies were predominantly single-arm studies, and were at unclear risk of several types of bias.

CONCLUSIONS:
The rabbit elastase aneurysm model was the only pre-clinical animal model used to assess WEB device performance. Safety outcomes were not evaluated in animal studies and could therefore not be compared to clinical outcomes. Efficacy outcomes were more heterogeneous in animal studies than in clinical studies. Future research should focus on improving methodology and reporting in order to draw accurate conclusions on the performance of the WEB device.","The Woven Endobridge (WEB) is designed to treat intracranial wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, preventing subarachnoid hemorrhage.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality or using it alone? A systematic review on health-related quality of life in neurological patients.,"BACKGROUND:
In the field of neurorehabilitation, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) have so far shown promising evidence on multiple motor and functional outcomes. The related effectiveness on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been investigated across neurological populations but still remains unclear. The present study aimed to systematically review the studies investigating the effects of RAT alone and with VR on HRQoL in patients with different neurological diseases.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the studies evaluating the impact of RAT alone and combined with VR on HRQoL in patients affected by neurological diseases (i.e., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's Disease) was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, and PsychINFO (2000-2022) were performed. Risk of bias was evaluated through the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Descriptive data regarding the study design, participants, intervention, rehabilitation outcomes, robotic device typology, HRQoL measures, non-motor factors concurrently investigated, and main results were extracted and meta-synthetized.

RESULTS:
The searches identified 3025 studies, of which 70 met the inclusion criteria. An overall heterogeneous configuration was found regarding the study design adopted, intervention procedures and technological devices implemented, rehabilitation outcomes (i.e., related to both upper and lower limb impairment), HRQoL measures administered, and main evidence. Most of the studies reported significant effects of both RAT and RAT plus VR on patients HRQoL, whether they adopted generic or disease-specific HRQoL measures. Significant post-intervention within-group changes were mainly found across neurological populations, while fewer studies reported significant between-group comparisons, and then, mostly in patients with stroke. Longitudinal investigations were also observed (up to 36Â months), but significant longitudinal effects were exclusively found in patients with stroke or multiple sclerosis. Finally, concurrent evaluations on non-motor outcomes beside HRQoL included cognitive (i.e., memory, attention, executive functions) and psychological (i.e., mood, satisfaction with the treatment, device usability, fear of falling, motivation, self-efficacy, coping, and well-being) variables.

CONCLUSIONS:
Despite the heterogeneity observed among the studies included, promising evidence was found on the effectiveness of RAT and RAT plus VR on HRQoL. However, further targeted short- and long-term investigations, are strongly recommended for specific HRQoL subcomponents and neurological populations, through the adoption of defined intervention procedures and disease-specific assessment methodology.","In the field of neurorehabilitation, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) have so far shown promising evidence on multiple motor and functional outcomes.

A clinical trial conducted on eight subacute stroke patients demonstrated improved fine hand motion rehabilitation training effectiveness with a system combining RAT and VR [2]. Another study involving 42 post-stroke patients showed both RAT and VR had positive effects on functional independence, with VR leading to increased overall cognitive changes and decreased anxiety levels, and RAT resulting in higher functional recovery in terms of decreased muscle tone, improved range of motion, hand dexterity, and grip strength [8]. A systematic review of 189 randomized controlled trials found that RAT was most effective for patients with severe-moderate impairments during the subacute phase, while VR and telerehabilitation (TR) were most effective for patients with mild impairments [17]. During the chronic phase, all technologies were equally effective for patients with mild impairments, with VR and RAT showing superiority to TR in improving motor function [17]. A pilot study involving 23 patients with acquired brain injury found that combining robotic therapy with VR led to significantly greater improvements in cognitive function and disability compared to robotic therapy alone [11]. A single-group pre- and post-intervention study involving 27 stroke survivors also found significant improvements in both upper-limb motor function and kinematics after 4 weeks of upper-limb robot-assisted therapy based on visual error augmentation in virtual reality [13].

TL;DR: The current evidence suggests that combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may lead to greater improvements in motor and cognitive function compared to using robot-assisted therapy alone in stroke rehabilitation, although more high-quality, large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Some studies found that the combination of RAT and VR can enhance the effectiveness of fine hand motion rehabilitation training in stroke patients [2, 3]. A meta-analysis suggested that VR, RAT, and telerehabilitation (TR) are at least as effective as conventional therapy for promoting active rehabilitation in patients with stroke, with VR and RAT proving superior to TR in improving motor function during the chronic phase [4]. Another randomized controlled clinical study is being planned to compare robot-assisted virtual reality mirror therapy (RAVRMT) with virtual reality mirror therapy (VRMT) alone in stroke patients [5]. Other studies have explored the use of VR, augmented reality (AR), or gamification-based exoskeletons in post-stroke rehabilitation, with general improvements in motor function observed [9]. A few studies have also investigated the effects of RAT with and without VR visual feedback in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI), with some suggesting that combining the two can enhance cognitive function recovery [11, 12]. However, it's important to note that many of these studies have small sample sizes, lack specific details about the study design, or are still in the protocol stage, limiting the strength of the evidence [1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12].

TL;DR: Based on the available evidence, combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation in patients with neuromotor diseases and stroke compared to using robot-assisted therapy alone. However, the strength of the evidence is limited due to small sample sizes, lack of detailed study designs, and ongoing studies.

Moreover, VR and RAT were found to be at least as effective as conventional therapy in stroke rehabilitation [14]. Lower limb robotic therapy, particularly when combined with VR, has shown beneficial effects on gait speed, endurance, balance, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis [20]. However, the evidence base is limited by the small sample sizes of many studies and potential risks of bias, which are often not reported [1,2,3,5,7,9,11,13,16,17,18,19,21,22].

Robot-assisted therapy can provide precise, repetitive, and intensive training, which is beneficial for motor recovery. It can also provide quantitative feedback and adjust the difficulty level based on the patient's performance. 

On the other hand, virtual reality can provide a more immersive and engaging environment for patients, which can motivate them to participate more actively in their rehabilitation. It can also simulate real-life situations, which can help patients to improve their functional abilities.

Combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality can potentially enhance the benefits of both approaches. The combination can provide a more comprehensive and effective rehabilitation program, which can lead to better outcomes for patients. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal combination of these two approaches for different types of patients and conditions.","Robot-assisted therapy can be combined with virtual reality or used alone, depending on the specific needs and goals of the patient. Both approaches have shown effectiveness in various medical conditions and rehabilitation settings. The decision to combine them or use them separately should be based on the individual patient's condition, preferences, and the expertise of the healthcare professionals involved in their care.","The papers suggest that combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may be more effective than using robot-assisted therapy alone. BrÃÂ¼tsch 2011 found that virtual reality-assisted therapy was more effective in initiating active participation during robot-assisted gait training in both patients and healthy controls. Johnson 2006 and Patton 2006 both suggest that incorporating virtual reality into robot-assisted therapy can improve functional outcomes and provide more natural movements. Zanatta 2022 found that virtual reality devices were perceived as having good usability and promoting patient engagement and motivation during treatment, while robot-assisted rehabilitation was considered useful in improving patients' physical independence and psychosocial well-being. Overall, the papers suggest that combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may be a promising approach to neuromotor rehabilitation."," Several studies have examined the effectiveness of combining robot-assisted therapy (RAT) with virtual reality (VR) or using them separately in stroke rehabilitation. A clinical trial conducted on eight subacute stroke patients demonstrated improved fine hand motion rehabilitation training effectiveness with a system combining RAT and VR [2]. Another study involving 42 post-stroke patients showed both RAT and VR had positive effects on functional independence, with VR leading to increased overall cognitive changes and decreased anxiety levels, and RAT resulting in higher functional recovery in terms of decreased muscle tone, improved range of motion, hand dexterity, and grip strength [8]. A systematic review of 189 randomized controlled trials found that RAT was most effective for patients with severe-moderate impairments during the subacute phase, while VR and telerehabilitation (TR) were most effective for patients with mild impairments [17]. During the chronic phase, all technologies were equally effective for patients with mild impairments, with VR and RAT showing superiority to TR in improving motor function [17]. A pilot study involving 23 patients with acquired brain injury found that combining robotic therapy with VR led to significantly greater improvements in cognitive function and disability compared to robotic therapy alone [11]. A single-group pre- and post-intervention study involving 27 stroke survivors also found significant improvements in both upper-limb motor function and kinematics after 4 weeks of upper-limb robot-assisted therapy based on visual error augmentation in virtual reality [13].

"," The current evidence suggests that combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may lead to greater improvements in motor and cognitive function compared to using robot-assisted therapy alone in stroke rehabilitation, although more high-quality, large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

"," A variety of studies have explored the use of robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) in rehabilitation, especially for patients with neuromotor diseases and stroke. Some studies found that the combination of RAT and VR can enhance the effectiveness of fine hand motion rehabilitation training in stroke patients [2, 3]. A meta-analysis suggested that VR, RAT, and telerehabilitation (TR) are at least as effective as conventional therapy for promoting active rehabilitation in patients with stroke, with VR and RAT proving superior to TR in improving motor function during the chronic phase [4]. Another randomized controlled clinical study is being planned to compare robot-assisted virtual reality mirror therapy (RAVRMT) with virtual reality mirror therapy (VRMT) alone in stroke patients [5]. Other studies have explored the use of VR, augmented reality (AR), or gamification-based exoskeletons in post-stroke rehabilitation, with general improvements in motor function observed [9]. A few studies have also investigated the effects of RAT with and without VR visual feedback in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI), with some suggesting that combining the two can enhance cognitive function recovery [11, 12]. However, it's important to note that many of these studies have small sample sizes, lack specific details about the study design, or are still in the protocol stage, limiting the strength of the evidence [1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12].

"," Based on the available evidence, combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality may enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation in patients with neuromotor diseases and stroke compared to using robot-assisted therapy alone. However, the strength of the evidence is limited due to small sample sizes, lack of detailed study designs, and ongoing studies.

"," The combination of robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) in rehabilitation has been demonstrated to improve motor function and quality of life in patients with neurological disorders, including stroke and multiple sclerosis [4,6,8,12,14,15,20,22]. Systematic reviews have shown that both RAT alone and in combination with VR have significant effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with neurological diseases [4]. In addition, RAT combined with VR has been shown to improve fine hand motion skills [2], cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and quality of life in stroke patients [8]. Moreover, VR and RAT were found to be at least as effective as conventional therapy in stroke rehabilitation [14]. Lower limb robotic therapy, particularly when combined with VR, has shown beneficial effects on gait speed, endurance, balance, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis [20].

","The use of robot-assisted therapy and virtual reality, either alone or combined, is a growing field and has the potential to positively affect patient outcomes. Robot-assisted therapy can lead to shorter hospital stays, lower volume of perioperative blood loss, better postoperative pain control, and faster time to recovery, while virtual reality can increase patient engagement (especially in the pediatric population) and motivation to help improve overall outcomes. In surgical specialties, the use of task trainers and virtual reality is also stirring as it demonstrates clinical competency and applies defined metrics for assessing proficiency. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and techniques like guided rehabilitation with embedded sensors, video games, or virtual reality based systems for rehabilitation have been shown to be beneficial in patients with apraxia.",0.7218859791755676,0.11235955056179775,0.23454553101709075,30.20825716832327,0.031315240083507306,0.8391748831603426,0.0,0.5548117454681132,0.2474207134161513,0.7312760353088379,0.10795454545454546,0.15783204288266825,37.01302642875544,0.055323590814196244,0.7571457623671768,0.0,0.5407858770126583,0.2570957360405087,0.7701767086982727,0.13034623217922608,0.15706806282722513,35.59243262527196,0.0824,1.0,0.0,0.5774531113166436,0.28928970861919934,0.7722776532173157,0.13963963963963963,0.18267464619090637,38.317898556976274,0.09073724007561437,0.9099386216146226,0.0,0.5929590534170469,0.2921341927226679,0.7255259156227112,0.0564516129032258,0.14376996805111822,28.481183856206925,0.015657620041753653,0.8400528750826173,0.0,0.5681331862623875,0.25121611487047835,0.7613336443901062,0.13991769547325103,0.17192302466192716,37.18987484260298,0.09745127436281859,0.9648076776959791,0.0,0.5739304675014025,0.28629146436974545,0.7632974982261658,0.13921113689095127,0.19542424968110722,39.85140047526719,0.10825688073394496,0.8297717009023894,0.0,0.5849327009759451,0.2879810453807137,0.741459846496582,0.10937500000000001,0.28418061072897216,33.271533771887505,0.04384133611691023,0.8627941805164454,0.0,0.5981915825977921,0.2648215438056056,0.7668076753616333,0.1461187214611872,0.21333120929145452,39.4267520796796,0.1111111111111111,0.8742567862513838,0.0,0.5755053051173116,0.2889761497645246,0.7681536078453064,0.1550387596899225,0.24390095614849283,40.48607091554923,0.10125260960334029,0.8044344617708795,0.0,0.5882527610612294,0.29095621130879656,0.7410581111907959,0.09523809523809525,0.19094766619519096,27.750118627635562,0.029227557411273485,0.8544777581125684,0.0,0.5828290427369731,0.25869711575065457,0.7298777103424072,0.09036144578313254,0.1736613603473227,36.0370899536797,0.03966597077244259,0.7540113884793329,0.0,0.5397405497069601,0.2587153197478723,0.742796778678894,0.11515151515151514,0.20418404685611333,37.28402401504173,0.05845511482254697,0.7686439997854972,0.0,0.5500236384570598,0.2654641715873446
cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Is ventricular lavage a novel treatment of neonatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus? a meta analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) may produce obliterative arachnoiditis, which disrupts the flow and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). PHH gives a high risk of neurofunctional impairment. Ventricular lavage is the treatment of choice for PHH in neonates with IVH for decades. It is developing with the combination of fibrinolytic therapy, also called drainage, irrigation, and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT), and with the use of neuroendoscopic apparatus, also called neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL).

METHODS:
This review is a meta-analysis using the PRISMA method guideline, including the clinical studies comparing ventricular lavage (VL) with standard treatment of PHH between 2000 and 2021.

RESULTS:
VL group reduced the shunt dependency compared to standard treatment (ORâ=â0.22; 95CI 0.05 to 0.97; pâ=â0.05). VL group has less infection risk compared to the standard treatment group (RRâ=â0.20; 95CI 0.07 to 0.59; pâ<â0.05). The severe neurofunctional outcome is similar between the two groups (ORâ=â0.99; 95CI 0.13 to 7.23; pâ=â0.99). The early approach treatment group may give better neurofunctional outcomes compared to the late approach (ORâ=â0.14; 95CI 0.06 to 0.35; pâ<â0.05).

CONCLUSION:
VL reduce the shunt dependency on the PHH, decreasing the shunt's related infection rate. The early ventricular lavage may give benefit for the neurocognitive outcome.","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) may produce obliterative arachnoiditis, which disrupts the flow and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH).

Similarly, a retrospective study found that NEL resulted in better neurological outcomes and reduced the incidence of meningitis and multiloculated hydrocephalus compared to traditional surgical methods [2]. Another study also found that endoscopic lavage was associated with a lower rate of shunt dependency, fewer necessary procedures, fewer infections, and fewer cases of supratentorial multiloculated hydrocephalus compared to conventional treatment [7]. Other studies have reported that NEL has comparable outcomes to other treatments for PHH [6], and that both NEL and ventriculosubgaleal shunt (VSgS) are effective treatment options for PHH, with specific advantages in selected patients [9]. However, these studies also noted potential biases due to their retrospective designs and lack of control groups [2,6,7,9,13]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that NEL appeared to be safer than drainage-irrigation-fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) in terms of the risk of hemorrhage and did not differ from other blood-product removal strategies in terms of mortality [15]. However, the study also called for further prospective and randomized studies to directly compare NEL with other temporizing procedures [15].

"," Current evidence suggests that ventricular lavage, including neuroendoscopic lavage, may be a beneficial treatment for neonatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, potentially reducing shunt dependency, infection risk, and incidence of meningitis and multiloculated hydrocephalus. However, further prospective and randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.

","Ventricular lavage is not a novel treatment for neonatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Treatment options for this condition typically involve a combination of medications, surgical interventions, and external drainage. Management of concomitant intraventricular hemorrhage and obstructive hydrocephalus usually requires placement of external ventricular drainage maintaining cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Other treatment options include intraventricular fibrinolytic administration, lumbar drainage, and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). Surgical treatment through ventricular shunt placement, choroid plexus cauterization, and anterior fontanelle ventricular tap placement is often used as a life-saving measure in cases of acute hydrocephalus.",0.7497174143791199,0.09090909090909091,0.08741775707843574,15.634198377964982,0.03597122302158273,1.0,0.0,0.4829098929058422,0.2505598941274963,0.7648266553878784,0.07272727272727272,0.08832669613098589,14.756766897243601,0.03513513513513514,1.0,0.0,0.4721365201789721,0.2551953449912285,0.7424837946891785,0.06976744186046512,0.04546856346995624,7.067244482855936,0.017304189435336976,1.0,0.0,0.4204967635894678,0.25375587285288576,0.7511621713638306,0.07048458149779736,0.05806304248515304,8.068170153171659,0.019916142557651992,1.0,0.0,0.4288279457719295,0.2577944447691123,0.7623660564422607,0.07272727272727274,0.06309148264984228,23.213531477143484,0.03278688524590164,1.0,0.0,0.4801495798996517,0.24844684557090002,0.7441228628158569,0.05907172995780591,0.038202247191011236,7.134847825308187,0.01443298969072165,1.0,0.0,0.42848352172480125,0.2535706304905845,0.7537845969200134,0.06091370558375634,0.04716981132075471,8.760273514380232,0.017902813299232736,1.0,0.0,0.443637634014902,0.26123146539414716,0.7656478881835938,0.0625,0.08413461538461539,20.20969582627921,0.03614457831325301,1.0,0.0,0.48318519393603004,0.25408519678778885,0.7482510805130005,0.0728476821192053,0.036206896551724134,6.18090828424827,0.015748031496062992,1.0,0.0,0.43309235960245135,0.26183630467420094,0.7485893964767456,0.0622568093385214,0.04751039501039502,7.406860264566764,0.01619047619047619,1.0,0.0,0.4344126975788083,0.2607975459807175,0.807248592376709,0.11594202898550725,0.11270491803278689,24.408380280870038,0.06060606060606061,1.0,0.0,0.5332731169003707,0.28906581256060493,0.7737939953804016,0.08391608391608392,0.08089598559759244,11.052085656223172,0.030120481927710843,1.0,0.0,0.49155109542640835,0.2759701666834343,0.7645322680473328,0.05263157894736841,0.03767491926803014,9.995601284921095,0.017766497461928935,1.0,0.0,0.4948886101504406,0.2628299819242386

The use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) is a debatable subject in the field of neuro-interventional surgery. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence from published studies on the outcomes of IVTâ+âMT compared with MT alone in AIS-LVO patients.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to January 2022 for relevant clinical trials and observational studies. Eligible studies were identified, and all relevant outcomes were pooled in the meta-analysis DerSimonian-Liard random-effects model.

RESULTS:
Forty-nine studies, with a total of 36,123 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. IVTâ+âMT was significantly superior to MT alone in terms of successful recanalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09), mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.82), favorable functional outcome (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29), and complete recanalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of improvement of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24Â h or at discharge (pâ>â0.05).

Further clinical trials are needed to corroborate such benefits of bridging IVT."," A multitude of studies have examined the use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The EXTEND-IA TNK study investigates the non-inferiority of tenecteplase compared to alteplase in achieving reperfusion at initial angiogram [1]. A review advocates for the use of IVT before MT within six hours of symptom onset, and in cases where IVT is contraindicated, MT should be considered [2]. A matched-control study involving 1026 patients found no significant differences in the 90-day modified Rankin Scale and successful recanalization between the MT group and the combined IVT+MT group [3]. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that both IVT and MT improved functional outcomes without increasing the risk of death in selected patients with wake-up strokes [4]. Guidelines by the European Stroke Organisation recommend the use of IVT within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to improve functional outcome and before MT [5]. A guideline based on two RCTs and twenty-six comparative observational studies also supports the use of IVT before MT in patients with large vessel occlusion [6]. A study with 107 patients found that MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcomes in patients with a mismatch ratio (MMRatio) >1.2 [7]. A secondary analysis of the DIRECT-MT trial found that alteplase treatment did not increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), or parenchymal hematoma (PH) after EVT [9]. A multicenter, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial involving 204 patients found that MT alone did not demonstrate noninferiority compared to combined IVT+MT for favorable functional outcome [20]. The SWIFT DIRECT study aims to determine whether patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion will have a non-inferior functional outcome at 90 days when treated with MT alone compared to combined treatment with IVT and MT [21].

TL;DR: The current evidence suggests that intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy can improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, although some studies are exploring the non-inferiority of mechanical thrombectomy alone. The choice of treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, timing, and available resources.

A multicentric retrospective cohort study developed a predictive score for early neurological deterioration following IVT in patients with acute minor stroke and LVO, suggesting a potential role for IVT in this context [4]. However, another retrospective cohort study suggested that MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with a mismatch ratio >1.2 [5].

A matched-control study also found no significant differences in the 90-day modified Rankin Scale and successful recanalization between the MT alone and combined IVT and MT groups, but the MT group had a shorter door-to-puncture time, lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and embolization compared to the combined group [14].

Similarly, a matched-control study of 1026 patients showed no significant differences in 90-day outcomes or successful recanalization between the two treatment approaches [3]. Another study involving 204 patients also found similar outcomes between the two groups [6].

Other studies highlighted the importance of individual patient characteristics, such as the size of the thrombus and the occlusion site [18], and the potential role of advanced neuroimaging techniques in guiding treatment decisions [7, 21].

TL;DR: The current evidence does not definitively favor either the use of intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy or mechanical thrombectomy alone for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, with some studies suggesting similar outcomes for both approaches and others suggesting potential benefits of combined therapy.

Current guidelines suggest that IVT should be administered to eligible patients before mechanical thrombectomy if it can be done within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. However, recent studies have shown that direct mechanical thrombectomy without prior IVT may be as effective and safe as the combined approach. Therefore, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the patient's condition, the time since stroke onset, and the resources available.","Intravenous thrombolysis is typically recommended as the first-line treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. It involves the administration of a clot-dissolving medication, such as alteplase, through an intravenous line. This treatment aims to restore blood flow to the affected area of the brain by dissolving the blood clot causing the occlusion.

Mechanical thrombectomy, on the other hand, involves the use of specialized devices to physically remove the blood clot from the blocked blood vessel. It is typically performed in conjunction with or as an alternative to intravenous thrombolysis.

The decision to use intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy depends on various factors, including the time of symptom onset, the patient's eligibility for thrombolysis, and the availability of endovascular treatment. In general, if a patient presents within the time window for thrombolysis and meets the eligibility criteria, intravenous thrombolysis is usually initiated first. If the patient does not respond to or is ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy may be considered as the primary treatment option.

It is important to note that the management of acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion should be individualized based on the patient's specific clinical presentation, imaging findings, and local treatment protocols. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a stroke specialist or refer to evidence-based guidelines for the most appropriate treatment approach in each case.","The papers suggest that there is still debate over whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) should be used before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). Katsanos 2019 questions the utility of bridging therapy (BT; IVT followed by MT) compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with LVO. Tsivgoulis 2018 found that pretreatment with systemic thrombolysis in patients with LVO eligible for mechanical thrombectomy results in successful reperfusion in 1 of 10 cases, negating the need for additional endovascular reperfusion. Li 2021 found that MT had comparable consequences to bridging treatment in efficacy and safety outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke caused by the occlusion of proximal anterior circulation, irrespective of geographical location."," A multitude of studies have examined the use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The EXTEND-IA TNK study investigates the non-inferiority of tenecteplase compared to alteplase in achieving reperfusion at initial angiogram [1]. A review advocates for the use of IVT before MT within six hours of symptom onset, and in cases where IVT is contraindicated, MT should be considered [2]. A matched-control study involving 1026 patients found no significant differences in the 90-day modified Rankin Scale and successful recanalization between the MT group and the combined IVT+MT group [3]. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that both IVT and MT improved functional outcomes without increasing the risk of death in selected patients with wake-up strokes [4]. Guidelines by the European Stroke Organisation recommend the use of IVT within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to improve functional outcome and before MT [5]. A guideline based on two RCTs and twenty-six comparative observational studies also supports the use of IVT before MT in patients with large vessel occlusion [6]. A study with 107 patients found that MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcomes in patients with a mismatch ratio (MMRatio) >1.2 [7]. A secondary analysis of the DIRECT-MT trial found that alteplase treatment did not increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), or parenchymal hematoma (PH) after EVT [9]. A multicenter, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial involving 204 patients found that MT alone did not demonstrate noninferiority compared to combined IVT+MT for favorable functional outcome [20]. The SWIFT DIRECT study aims to determine whether patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion will have a non-inferior functional outcome at 90 days when treated with MT alone compared to combined treatment with IVT and MT [21].

"," The current evidence suggests that intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy can improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, although some studies are exploring the non-inferiority of mechanical thrombectomy alone. The choice of treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, timing, and available resources.

"," Several studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) prior to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). A retrospective study found no significant difference in clinical outcomes or recanalization rates between patients treated with IVT and MT versus MT alone [2]. A multicentric retrospective cohort study developed a predictive score for early neurological deterioration following IVT in patients with acute minor stroke and LVO, suggesting a potential role for IVT in this context [4]. However, another retrospective cohort study suggested that MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with a mismatch ratio >1.2 [5]. A randomized, open-label, noninferiority clinical trial found no significant difference in favorable outcome between the MT alone group and the combined IVT and MT group [7]. A matched-control study also found no significant differences in the 90-day modified Rankin Scale and successful recanalization between the MT alone and combined IVT and MT groups, but the MT group had a shorter door-to-puncture time, lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and embolization compared to the combined group [14].

"," Current evidence suggests that there may not be a significant benefit of using intravenous thrombolysis prior to mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, although the evidence is mixed and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombolysis (MT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) is a complex topic with varying evidence. A large meta-analysis of seven clinical trials involving 2317 patients found no significant differences in outcomes between MT plus IVT and MT alone, except for procedural time [4]. Similarly, a matched-control study of 1026 patients showed no significant differences in 90-day outcomes or successful recanalization between the two treatment approaches [3]. Another study involving 204 patients also found similar outcomes between the two groups [6]. However, a different systematic review and meta-analysis including 49 studies with 36,123 patients suggested that IVT plus MT was superior to MT alone in terms of successful recanalization, mortality, and functional outcomes [14]. Other studies highlighted the importance of individual patient characteristics, such as the size of the thrombus and the occlusion site [18], and the potential role of advanced neuroimaging techniques in guiding treatment decisions [7, 21].

"," The current evidence does not definitively favor either the use of intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy or mechanical thrombectomy alone for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, with some studies suggesting similar outcomes for both approaches and others suggesting potential benefits of combined therapy. Decisions should be individualized based on patient characteristics and potentially guided by advanced neuroimaging.

","Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase should be used before mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion if they present within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and without any absolute contraindications. Mechanical thrombectomy is beneficial when an acute ischemic stroke results from a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion and is the standard of care in such cases. It can be done within 6 hours from symptom onset in five different randomized controlled clinical trials, and up to 24 hours in selected patients to save the viable brain tissues at risk as demonstrated in the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials. Additionally, patients must also undergo a CT angiogram of the head and neck or a CT perfusion scan of the head before opting for mechanical thrombectomy, respectively.",0.6835460066795349,0.08877284595300261,0.10322047894302229,20.69420010020592,0.0486815415821501,1.0,0.0,0.4882970848461477,0.23046581323172594,0.7107440233230591,0.09811320754716982,0.14341057980326058,27.903330242864282,0.04201680672268908,0.8427844666493538,0.0,0.504612639349028,0.2427310407645223,0.7831289172172546,0.11494252873563218,0.15850981183244728,22.59294548545662,0.07125748502994012,1.0,0.0,0.5693318432452632,0.30139662287010544,0.7880197167396545,0.1279317697228145,0.1687934734298097,26.05759507103414,0.07880055788005579,1.0,0.0,0.5773426669568015,0.3036070506474262,0.6999167203903198,0.06862745098039216,0.17130809595202404,28.321228310771506,0.022408963585434174,0.7937581841990398,0.0,0.5239741696338904,0.22912988829006942,0.782515287399292,0.14795918367346939,0.16303517549272478,29.670666858303484,0.08411214953271028,1.0,0.0,0.5878207612563582,0.30242959899407734,0.7900915741920471,0.16763005780346824,0.19992578503331504,34.10470729933561,0.09540229885057472,1.0,0.0,0.6093051769379256,0.3071911662279345,0.6996811628341675,0.06091370558375635,0.1621160409556314,27.87759615557447,0.0196078431372549,0.8202617174136162,0.0,0.5594432763123917,0.2280279200112894,0.7589277625083923,0.15789473684210525,0.17253571270031517,28.950152074513667,0.10789980732177264,1.0,0.0,0.5613788010732407,0.2837218623690457,0.7673913240432739,0.18238993710691823,0.24042534908700325,36.76376852177349,0.14025974025974025,0.935478199718706,0.0,0.5917566119334399,0.2915289802411666,0.7032632231712341,0.05633802816901408,0.13531799729364005,28.681085591837885,0.0196078431372549,0.7981002827982775,0.0,0.5269758788978353,0.23066117193892294,0.7363111972808838,0.11721611721611722,0.1651440618411806,30.72301000342087,0.058823529411764705,0.877725035161744,0.0,0.5569897715132035,0.2648715561121185,0.7133095860481262,0.10676156583629894,0.1521180492934429,30.97952385223573,0.05042016806722689,0.8341219610206952,0.0,0.5037539119521777,0.241922880213788
cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Are beta blockers effective in preventing stroke-associated infections? - a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Excessive sympathoexcitation could lead to stroke associated infection. Inhibiting sympathetic excitation may reduce the infection risk after stroke. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the protective effect of beta blockers on stroke associated infection through systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
A systematic search of multiple databases were performed up to February 2022. The included studies required beta blockers therapy in stroke patients and assessed the incidence of stroke-associated infections. Outcomes of interest included infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis. Random-effects model was used for analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics and publication bias was evaluated by the funnel plot.

RESULT:
A total of 83 potentially relevant publications was identified in the initial search. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The risk of bias in the included articles satisfies the quality requirement of meta-analysis. No significant associations between beta blockers therapy and the prevention of stroke associated infection, stroke associated pneumonia and septicemia were found, However, subgroup analyses revealed an association between beta blockers treatment and the increased risk of post-stroke urinary tract infection or stroke associated pneumonia in some stroke patients (OR = 1.69 [1.33, 2.14], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR = 1.85 [1.51, 2.26], <i>P</i> < 0.0001).

CONCLUSION:
Due to the lack of robust evidence, this meta-analysis may not support the preventive effect of beta blockers on stroke associated infection. But beta blockers treatment may be associated with development of post-stroke urinary tract infection and stroke associated pneumonia in some stroke patients.","Excessive sympathoexcitation could lead to stroke associated infection.

"," The effectiveness of beta blockers in preventing stroke-associated infections remains a topic of debate, with studies providing mixed results. A systematic review and meta-analysis did not show a significant association between beta blocker therapy and the prevention of stroke-associated infections, although subgroup analyses revealed an association between beta blocker treatment and an increased risk of post-stroke urinary tract infection or stroke-associated pneumonia in some stroke patients [1]. A prospective clinical trial with 2,538 patients found that beta-blocker treatment at baseline was associated with an increased risk of infection and pneumonia during the clinical course, but not with mortality or unfavorable outcome at 3 months [2]. Another study found that on-stroke beta blocker therapy was associated with reduced mortality and a reduced frequency of pneumonia, but not with functional outcome [3]. A retrospective study found that beta blocker use was associated with increased infections compared to no beta blocker use, specifically, non-selective beta blocker use was associated with increased infections and UTIs [4]. A meta-analysis of more than 100,000 patients found no significant association between beta-blocker treatment and mortality, functional outcome, or post-stroke infections [10]. 

"," Current evidence does not consistently support the effectiveness of beta blockers in preventing stroke-associated infections, with some studies suggesting a potential increased risk of certain infections. Further research is needed to clarify these findings.

","The available evidence suggests that beta blockers can be effective in reducing the risk of stroke-related complications. Studies have shown that the preoperative use of beta-blockers was associated with a reduction in cardiac events, although this was not associated with a decrease in surgical deaths. Additionally, the CIBIS II, MERIT-HF, and CAPRICORN trials showed that long-term beta blocker use reduced mortality and improved outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy accompanied by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Furthermore, the POISE trial showed that beta-blockers used on the day of surgery had a greater risk than those taken preoperatively. As such, current guidelines recommend preoperative beta blocker use for high risk patients and avoiding use on the day of surgery. Aspirin and statins are also used as adjunctive medical therapy.",0.8084331154823303,0.19704433497536947,0.2509684429327287,39.92185756750901,0.0970464135021097,0.8615448968209705,0.0,0.5899359954055399,0.30542348025523336,0.788471519947052,0.14444444444444443,0.21262441470716167,37.147219076553405,0.07253886010362694,0.8691206543967279,0.0,0.5608675631712068,0.2908694632649021,0.8304663300514221,0.22297297297297297,0.16172046826249303,32.53227182917357,0.07637231503579953,1.0,0.0,0.5961295995203888,0.3313856715603557,0.829319953918457,0.2262773722627737,0.17929844388004995,33.6953373584182,0.08042895442359249,1.0,0.0,0.5983565903550856,0.3302925724430215,0.8224647045135498,0.1946902654867257,0.2247191011235955,33.595589540221034,0.023316062176165803,0.8552357119793349,0.0,0.7258026817670236,0.32226433268798715,0.8377043604850769,0.2387096774193548,0.18515431841542349,34.126922829284,0.0801781737193764,1.0,0.0,0.6208396380735656,0.3404473119996021,0.8395955562591553,0.2573529411764706,0.18415087567561272,38.60100320926454,0.08493150684931507,1.0,0.0,0.6303128780150901,0.34192968417547753,0.8265554904937744,0.2325581395348837,0.34854794520547944,39.58737700133435,0.05958549222797927,0.788519783726839,0.0,0.6668339782290988,0.3187323989656384,0.861757755279541,0.26299694189602446,0.22121656444634624,35.29070417883972,0.12828282828282828,1.0,0.0,0.6489350681587801,0.3595500506052908,0.8641636967658997,0.296551724137931,0.24065568839580487,40.26253909510401,0.14527845036319612,1.0,0.0,0.661522246837616,0.3639732133903835,0.833869457244873,0.21875,0.34765165963513067,40.385303678295884,0.06217616580310881,0.7254601226993865,0.0,0.7041907876729965,0.3292654292632637,0.885632336139679,0.4324324324324324,0.35449257780502963,56.64535933723216,0.2619047619047619,0.9361025903203817,0.0,0.7204208532509776,0.3816868363206385,0.8068881034851074,0.17621145374449337,0.1391941391941392,32.18891187905572,0.06989247311827956,1.0,0.0,0.5790967218454371,0.3050757790656163
cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Does acupuncture therapy improve language function of patients with aphasia following ischemic stroke? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Aphasia is one of the most common complications in patients with ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that acupuncture can improve the symptoms of aphasia patients. However, the effect of acupuncture on language function in patients with ischemic stroke is still controversial.

OBJECTIVE:
This study aimed to critically assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for aphasia following ischemic stroke.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Digital Periodicals, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals database were searched. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the criteria were included.

RESULTS:
Meta-analyses showed that mean difference in change of auditory comprehension score (MDâ=â7.71, 95% CI: 1.83 to 13.59, Pâ=â0.01), spontaneous speech (MDâ=â2.77, 95% CI: 0.59 to 4.95, Pâ=â0.01), repetition score (MDâ=â14.48, 95% CI: 11.04 to 17.91, Pâ<â0.00001) and naming score (MDâ=â14.60, 95% CI: 11.33 to 17.88, Pâ<â0.00001) measured by WAB scale were statistically significant. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that there were statistically significant mean differences in four items of WAB scale in patients with sub-acute stroke, and no statistically significant differences in patients with acute stroke.

CONCLUSION:
The present study suggests that acupuncture may improve the language function of patients with aphasia following ischemic stroke, especially during the sub-acute phase. However, due to insufficient sample sizes and information on the safety, more high-quality RCTs are still needed.",This study aimed to critically assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for aphasia following ischemic stroke.,"PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Digital Periodicals, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals database were searched.

","Based on research, patients with aphasia following an ischemic stroke have a peak rate of language function recovery within two to six months post-stroke.

cardiovascular medicine,hypertension,Nifedipine or amlodipine? The choice for hypertension during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
There is a lack of sufficient evidence regarding efficacy and safety of amlodipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE:
To compare antihypertensive efficacy, pregnancy outcome and safety of amlodipine with nifedipine on hypertension during pregnancy.

METHODS:
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine disc of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April l5, 2021 was conducted on RCTs comparing amlodipine to nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. To estimate relative effects from all available evidence, a meta-analysis was conducted.

RESULTS:
Seventeen RCTs were included. Amlodipine was found the efficacy is slightly superior to nifedipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10) with a decreased risk for maternal side effects (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.61). Subgroup analysis found amlodipine can get a better control on SBP (RR -Â 11.68, 95% CI -Â 17.98 to -Â 5.37) and DBP (RR -Â 7.44, 95% CI -Â 13.81 to -Â 1.06) compared with intermediate-/long-acting nifedipine. In addition, there was no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine on pregnancy outcomes including caesarean section, premature labour, placental abruption, FGR, fetal distress, neonatal asphyxia.

CONCLUSIONS:
Given the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, amlodipine can be effectively and safely used for hypertension during pregnancy.","To compare antihypertensive efficacy, pregnancy outcome and safety of amlodipine with nifedipine on hypertension during pregnancy.","A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine disc of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April l5, 2021 was conducted on RCTs comparing amlodipine to nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy.

Similarly, a multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled trial involving 894 pregnant women with severe hypertension found that nifedipine use resulted in a greater frequency of primary outcome attainment compared to labetalol or methyldopa [8]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies also found nifedipine to have a low risk of persistent hypertension compared to hydralazine and labetalol [9].

The choice between nifedipine and amlodipine for treating hypertension during pregnancy depends on various factors, including the individual patient's medical history, the severity of hypertension, and any other existing medical conditions. It is important for pregnant women with hypertension to consult with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for their specific situation.

It is worth noting that the safety and efficacy of both nifedipine and amlodipine in pregnancy have been studied, and they are generally considered safe to use.

","The optimal approach for treating hypertension during pregnancy is to target a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg and use antihypertensive agents, such as amlodipine, nifedipine, labetalol, or methyldopa. Nifedipine, which has been given once in the ED, is an acceptable choice for acute events, whereas amlodipine is an excellent long-term first-line choice due to its longer half-life and once-daily dosing. In the case of the patient in the ED, renal ultrasound and other labs were ordered and amlodipine 5 mg daily was initiated.

cardiovascular medicine,lipid disorders,Does chronic high-intensity endurance training have an effect on cardiovascular markers of active populations and athletes? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to ascertain the effects of high-intensity chronic endurance training on cardiovascular markers of active populations and athletes.

METHODS:
This review was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We used databases of PubMed, Science Direct, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar and grey literatures with Mesh and free-text search as well as manual searches to identify relevant studies from June 2017 to September 2019. Weighted standardised mean differences and effect size of the intervention group versus the control group were calculated using a random effect model with 95% CI.

RESULT:
There was significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-1.06 (-1.83 to -0.30), p=0.006. We have also observed a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-0.97 (-1.58 to -0.36), p=0.002, and = -0.78 (-1.34 to -0.22), p=0.007, respectively. There was a significant reduction in interleukin 6 (IL-6) using a fixed effect model with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-0.87 (-1.33 to -0.40), p=0.0003 and C reactive protein (CRP) with weighted standardised mean differences and effect size=-0.41 (-0.73 to -0.09), p=0.01.

CONCLUSION:
Chronic high-intensity endurance training improves healthy lipid profiles (increase high-density lipoprotein, decreased low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol). And decreased inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) independent of age and sex and cannot be associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Studies have shown that higher exercise frequency can lead to increased maximal oxygen uptake, larger left ventricular mass, improved heart rate and blood pressure control, and greater cardiac output and stroke volume during maximal exercise [1]. However, excessive endurance exercise may lead to pathological structural changes in the heart, including transient right ventricular dysfunction and elevation of cardiac biomarkers [2]. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) may have more favorable effects on arterial stiffness compared to moderate continuous training (MCT) [4]. Despite these benefits, high-volume and/or high-intensity long-term exercise training may lead to accelerated coronary artery calcification, exercise-induced cardiac biomarker release, myocardial fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, and a higher risk of sudden cardiac death [6]. Furthermore, prolonged and intense exercise may have adverse effects on cardiac function in some individuals [7]. It's also noted that the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is low in young competitive athletes but increases in aging athletes, possibly due to accumulated training hours and participation in competitions [8].

On the molecular level, aerobic exercise has been shown to elicit adaptations leading to improved performance. Thus, it can be concluded that high-intensity endurance training can be an effective tool in reducing the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular issues for athletes and active individuals.",0.8012398481369019,0.16666666666666666,0.1664257332071902,26.61619802841917,0.058823529411764705,1.0,0.0,0.5741210589724138,0.2984982073692047,0.7988280057907104,0.23140495867768593,0.21483676493128284,30.92237651221025,0.08083832335329341,1.0,0.0,0.5806963947859216,0.2930314215692021,0.7530824542045593,0.1033210332103321,0.0733299226392571,12.717688402802748,0.02697495183044316,1.0,0.0,0.4988768063248343,0.2713493155362091,0.762292742729187,0.11255411255411255,0.06835443037974683,15.0257235709332,0.03278688524590164,1.0,0.0,0.5111067033865873,0.2766621123192478,0.7909327745437622,0.19277108433734938,0.23516206366143313,38.63266421370492,0.08602150537634409,0.7031926406926408,0.0,0.5915923019250234,0.2924158137866288,0.7501431107521057,0.1,0.07063040982538601,12.497613390028803,0.02783109404990403,1.0,0.0,0.4842844786934363,0.2650171277824152,0.7517784833908081,0.11475409836065574,0.08232803702164848,14.444102947414695,0.03258426966292135,1.0,0.0,0.4920220746205199,0.2685677913941894,0.7779120206832886,0.2278481012658228,0.2828569047420618,41.74247499252752,0.0913978494623656,0.7356601731601732,0.0,0.5836229473352432,0.2719448524129875,0.7542046904563904,0.14760147601476015,0.07170904019041556,14.8216985714582,0.0330812854442344,1.0,0.0,0.4749148629775653,0.26670668635147804,0.7587586641311646,0.16964285714285715,0.09360264354596369,18.229982744580084,0.04079254079254079,1.0,0.0,0.4819791830382366,0.26973451469152576,0.7821062803268433,0.24444444444444444,0.21852651787856972,37.63087693295357,0.11827956989247312,0.75,0.0,0.5805587139996615,0.28558885880211293,0.8051759004592896,0.31693989071038253,0.21258183215357102,26.879604900234185,0.15292096219931273,1.0,0.0,0.5396409574515966,0.304433490851909,0.8006737232208252,0.1891891891891892,0.14859059987518902,24.72307255371132,0.0576036866359447,1.0,0.0,0.5562943234443665,0.2909626290768416
cardiovascular medicine,lipid disorders,Are women with type 2 diabetes mellitus more susceptible to cardiovascular complications following coronary angioplasty?: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Scientific reports have shown Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to be independently associated with adverse outcomes following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). However, gender difference has also often been a controversial issue following PCI. Till date, very few meta-analyses have systematically compared the adverse cardiovascular outcomes in male versus female patients with T2DM following PCI. Therefore, we aimed to carry out this analysis in order to find out an answer to this interesting question.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were searched for English language publications reporting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in male versus female patients with diabetes mellitus respectively following coronary angioplasty. The RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze selected adverse cardiovascular events whereby Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were the statistical parameters.

RESULTS:
A total number of 19,304 patients with T2DM (12,986 male patients versus 6318 female patients) were included in this analysis. At baseline, female patients were older (68.7 versus 62.9Â years), with a higher percentage of hypertension (75.6% versus 66.5%) and dyslipidemia (53.3% versus 50.0%) whereas majority of the male patients were smokers (46.3% versus 14.9%). Results of this analysis showed short and long-term mortality to be significantly higher in female patients with T2DM (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.46-2.00; PÂ =Â 0.00001), and (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35; PÂ =Â 0.002) respectively. In addition, women were also more at risk for short and long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) with OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07; PÂ =Â 0.02 and OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.28; PÂ =Â 0.009 respectively. Subgroup analysis showed this significant result to have mainly been observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared to those with stable coronary artery disease.

CONCLUSIONS:
Following PCI, women with T2DM were indeed more susceptible to short and long-term cardiovascular complications compared to male patients with the same chronic disease. Even though this result was more applicable to patients with acute myocardial infarction, the fact that women were older with higher co-morbidities at baseline compared to men, should also not be ignored.","Scientific reports have shown Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to be independently associated with adverse outcomes following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).

Several studies have indicated that women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at a higher risk of cardiovascular complications. The review by Beckman et al. [3] suggests that diabetes mellitus significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, with outcomes following revascularization procedures being less favorable compared to non-diabetic cohorts. Similarly, a cross-sectional study by Kautzky-Willer et al. [8] found that women with T2DM had a worse cardiovascular risk profile and achieved therapeutic goals less frequently than men. A review by Gender Medicine [9] also noted that women with diabetes have a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and a poorer prognosis after myocardial infarction compared to men with diabetes. However, data from the BARI 2D trial [2, 5, 7] showed no sex differences in death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident after adjusting for baseline variables, but women reported more angina, and the benefits of revascularization were observed particularly in high-risk patients. A large cohort study [6] also found that major coronary heart disease events were less frequent in women compared to men.

Women with type 2 diabetes mellitus appear to have a higher risk of cardiovascular complications and may have less favorable outcomes following coronary angioplasty, but more research is needed to clarify these relationships.

","Women with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to their higher propensity for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. These complications can lead to an increased risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. To mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle change education and risk factor management are recommended, including management of hypertension and dyslipidemia. In addition, Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs, GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or GLP-1 analogs) may be considered to reduce cardiovascular risks. Women with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be more susceptible to cardiovascular complications following coronary angioplasty due to underlying risk factors associated with their diabetes, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia.

dermatology,acne,Is acne in adolescence associated with prostate cancer risk? Evidence from a meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Previous studies regarding the relationship between acne and prostate cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We performed the present meta-analysis of observational studies to summarize the evidence on this association.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search up to March 2018 was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with a random effects model. The Q statistic and the I2 index were used to evaluate the heterogeneity across the studies.

RESULTS:
Eight studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, no significant association was found between acne and prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.25). A significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (P = 0.006, I2 = 64.5%). In the subgroup analysis by study design, a significant association was observed in the cohort studies (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.93) but not in the case-control studies (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.86-1.12).

CONCLUSIONS:
In summary, this meta-analysis did not find an association between acne in adolescence and prostate cancer risk. However, because there was some heterogeneity in the overall analysis and a significant association was observed in the meta-analysis of the cohort studies, further well-designed large prospective studies are warranted to confirm our results.",Previous studies regarding the relationship between acne and prostate cancer risk have reported inconsistent results.

A population-based, case-control study in Australia found that certain measures of acne, such as facial acne scarring, were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer [1]. Another case-control study found that higher levels of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) antibodies, which are often present in individuals with acne, were associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer [2]. However, a study utilizing data from the Glasgow Alumni Cohort Study found some evidence of a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality in individuals with a history of acne [3]. Lastly, a large population-based cohort study of young men in Sweden found that a diagnosis of acne was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly for advanced stage disease [4]. The studies present mixed results, with some suggesting a reduced risk and others an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with acne.

TL;DR: The evidence is mixed regarding the association between acne in adolescence and prostate cancer risk, with some studies suggesting a reduced risk and others an increased risk. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship.

A systematic search from inception to September 2018 in Embase, MEDLINE and BIOSIS was performed. Search terms included all synonyms for AD and filaggrin/FLG; any genetic or epidemiological study design using any statistical methods were included. Quality assessment using criteria modified from guidance (ROBINS-I and Human Genome Epidemiology Network) for nonrandomized and genetic studies was completed, including consideration of power. Heterogeneity of study design and analyses precluded the use of meta-analysis.

RESULTS:
Of 1817 papers identified, 12 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria required and performed formal interaction testing. There was some evidence for FLG-environment interactions in six of the studies (P-value for interaction â¤ 0Â·05), including early-life cat ownership, older siblings, water hardness, phthalate exposure, higher urinary phthalate metabolite levels (which all increased AD risk additional to FLG null genotype) and prolonged breastfeeding (which decreased AD risk in the context of FLG null genotype). Major limitations of published studies were the low numbers of individuals (ranging from five to 94) with AD and FLG loss-of-function mutations and exposure to specific environmental factors, and variation in exposure definitions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Evidence on FLG-environment interactions in AD aetiology is limited. However, many of the studies lacked large enough sample sizes to assess these interactions fully. Further research is needed with larger sample sizes and clearly defined exposure assessment. Linked Comment:Â Park and Seo.

However, many of the studies lacked large enough sample sizes to assess these interactions fully. "," The etiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) is complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors [14]. The strongest genetic risk factor identified for AD is loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) [2]. Filaggrin plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the skin barrier [5,9]. These mutations, combined with environmental exposures, can lead to impaired skin barrier function, contributing to the development and severity of AD [4,13]. Several environmental triggers, such as in utero exposure to tobacco smoke or phthalates, have been suggested to impact the development of AD [4]. Filaggrin deficiency may also contribute to enhanced Staphylococcus aureus colonization, a common feature in AD patients [1,10]. However, the link between filaggrin null mutations, environmental exposures, and the development of AD is complex and requires further research for a complete understanding [4,13,14].

TL;DR: There is substantial evidence that filaggrin null mutations, when combined with certain environmental exposures, can contribute to the development and severity of atopic dermatitis. However, the relationship is complex and further research is needed for a more precise understanding.

Several studies suggest that filaggrin deficiency in AD may be related to increased colonization by Staphylococcus aureus [4] and that early-onset and severe AD, along with other factors such as parental atopic history and nonrural environment, are risk factors for developing multiple atopic comorbidities [6, 7]. However, the specific mechanisms for developing these comorbidities after AD onset are still poorly understood [6]. The role of environmental factors such as allergen exposure and the hygiene hypothesis in the etiology of AD is also highlighted, with epigenetic alterations in response to these factors playing a significant role [9]. Despite the growing body of evidence, the fundamental defects driving AD remain controversial, with theories ranging from an ""outside in"" approach focusing on skin barrier defects to an ""inside out"" approach emphasizing overexpression of type 2 immune pathways in the skin [10]. Moreover, a large meta-analysis involving 33 RCTs and 25,827 participants found that skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema, may increase the risk of food allergy, and probably increase the risk of skin infection [12, 8].

These mutations cause a deficiency in the filaggrin protein, which is crucial for skin barrier function. 

Several studies have shown that environmental exposures can interact with filaggrin null mutations to exacerbate the risk of atopic dermatitis. For instance, individuals with filaggrin null mutations who are exposed to certain allergens or irritants may have an increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis. 

A study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that filaggrin null mutations and exposure to cat allergen were synergistically associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis. Another study in the British Journal of Dermatology found that filaggrin null mutations and exposure to hard water (water with high mineral content) were associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis.

However, the exact mechanisms by which these environmental exposures interact with filaggrin null mutations to increase the risk of atopic dermatitis are not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.","Several studies have provided evidence for interactions between filaggrin null mutations and environmental exposures in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. Filaggrin is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the skin barrier function. Null mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) have been associated with an increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis.

Environmental exposures, such as exposure to allergens, irritants, and microbial agents, have been shown to interact with filaggrin null mutations to increase the risk of developing atopic dermatitis. For example, exposure to house dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and certain foods has been found to have a stronger effect on the development of atopic dermatitis in individuals with filaggrin null mutations compared to those without these mutations.

Additionally, exposure to environmental pollutants, such as tobacco smoke and air pollution, has been shown to interact with filaggrin null mutations to increase the risk of atopic dermatitis. These exposures can disrupt the skin barrier function and enhance the penetration of allergens and irritants, leading to increased inflammation and susceptibility to atopic dermatitis.

Overall, the evidence suggests that there is a significant interaction between filaggrin null mutations and environmental exposures in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. Understanding these interactions can help in identifying individuals at higher risk and developing targeted preventive strategies for atopic dermatitis.","The papers have mixed findings on the interactions between filaggrin null mutations and environmental exposures in the aetiology of atopic dermatitis. Blakeway 2019 conducted a systematic review and found evidence for gene-environment interactions in atopic dermatitis. However, Park 2020 argued that the evidence for such interactions is currently lacking due to limitations in the published studies. Morar 2007 found that filaggrin mutations are associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma, and atopy, but the mutations were also present in children without atopic dermatitis. Enomoto 2008 found that filaggrin null mutations are associated with atopic dermatitis and elevated levels of IgE in the Japanese population.

","Recent evidence suggests a strong link between filaggrin null mutations and environmental exposures in the aetiology of atopic dermatitis. One major genetic mutation found in the gene Filaggrin leads to dysfunctional skin cell organization which results in a 'leaky' skin barrier. Additionally, decreased levels of beta-defensins are found in patients with eczema, which increases susceptibility to infection by certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Patients with the atopic triad—atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma—have a defective barrier in the skin, upper respiratory, and lower respiratory tract which leads to their symptomatology. Loss-of-function mutations involving the filaggrin gene have been found to be associated with many conditions, including monogenic genodermatosis ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. All these findings suggest that the risk for atopic dermatitis increases if a patient carries a mutation in the filaggrin gene and is exposed to environmental allergens and other elements.",0.7113471627235413,0.075,0.04087338026731966,7.310036060761822,0.014736842105263158,1.0,0.0,0.40334903149311724,0.23456471202514834,0.7136161923408508,0.07179487179487179,0.06076743410076744,8.247146406513775,0.02077562326869806,1.0,0.0,0.41318270257102574,0.23693558052780878,0.7176045775413513,0.057692307692307696,0.045561237694895895,7.9510584178722254,0.017321016166281754,1.0,0.0,0.4100278009098905,0.23848385633857758,0.7184205055236816,0.05988023952095809,0.047389031613501754,10.05587231784262,0.02225519287833828,1.0,0.0,0.4083686463066921,0.2370552902489442,0.7822813391685486,0.09375000000000001,0.17588652482269504,22.303776135190397,0.06470588235294118,1.0,0.0,0.5363678479194641,0.27418056877445685,0.7196598052978516,0.05095541401273886,0.029411764705882346,6.318043463703399,0.01564828614008942,1.0,0.0,0.39076146352941615,0.23319445877751635,0.7255890369415283,0.0606060606060606,0.033138401559454196,7.265777455904675,0.017825311942959002,1.0,0.0,0.39713785356682973,0.23681383580597276,0.7684106230735779,0.1095890410958904,0.0823045267489712,23.904385701057148,0.03535353535353535,1.0,0.0,0.4890869655570046,0.25862442619882764,0.7498670816421509,0.0995475113122172,0.0407088122605364,9.07816324768264,0.02178649237472767,1.0,0.0,0.45963570119982416,0.2673078706162984,0.7545634508132935,0.10752688172043011,0.05707250897920888,10.968961949520423,0.026246719160104987,1.0,0.0,0.46581280241776174,0.2714906367132446,0.8081163167953491,0.2413793103448276,0.14619883040935672,29.569053098168872,0.06716417910447761,1.0,0.0,0.5753226429224014,0.29039208409297873,0.7794776558876038,0.10126582278481013,0.07544516597936515,12.44262164764437,0.0353356890459364,1.0,0.0,0.49055907817987293,0.281828097451925,0.7222592234611511,0.08092485549132948,0.0411522633744856,8.649578267526921,0.01757188498402556,1.0,0.0,0.4033238469199701,0.23345543909293298
dermatology,dermatologic surgery,Is Orbicularis Oculi Muscle Resection Necessary in Upper Blepharoplasty? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Our objective is to evaluate the evidence on the aesthetic effect and complications of skin-OOM strip resection compared to skin only upper blepharoplasty.

METHODS:
A systematic search of EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases was performed using our search strategy through to 31 December 2019. Only comparative studies of the two upper blepharoplasty techniques were included. Three reviewers performed study selection process, data extraction, and quality assessment.

RESULTS:
A total of six articles were eligible for final inclusion. The included studies consist of two controlled retrospective cohorts and four small randomized controlled studies (RCT). Three of which, were double blinded. Those RCTs were assigned level 2 evidence due to small size and methodological limitations. The sample size of included was studies 407 in the two retrospective studies and 57 in the four RCTs. The outcomes showed that resection of OOM along with skin in upper blepharoplasty showed no difference in long-term aesthetic outcome when skin only procedure is performed. Muscle strip resection was associated with initially higher ophthalmological morbidity (edema, bruising, pain, dry eye, sluggish eye closure and lagopthalmos). Those resolved aÂ few weeks later with conservative treatment.

CONCLUSION:
The resection of OOM along with skin in upper blepharoplasty showed no difference in long-term aesthetic outcome and was associated with initially higher ophthalmological morbidity compared to skin only procedure. While we are not suggesting that OOM resection is never required, the evidence strongly support its preservation during standard upper blepharoplasty.

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Does oral lichen planus aggravate the state of periodontal disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) was to assess the evidence between the association of oral lichen planus and periodontal disease, evaluating the periodontal clinical parameters and biomarkers levels.

METHODS:
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181513). Searches were accomplished in databases for articles published until June 2021. The meta-analysis was performed with the variables: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). The mean difference was applied with a 95% confidence interval.

RESULTS:
Six articles were included. Qualitative analysis showed the levels of biomarkers (matrix metalloproteinases, interleukins, and periodontal microbiological profile) are increased in subjects with periodontal disease and oral lichen planus. In the meta-analysis, these subjects also presented increases in all periodontal clinical parameters evaluated: GI-gingivitis 0.22 [0.14, 0.31] pâ<â0.0001 and periodontitis 0.12 [0.06, 0.19]Â pâ=â0.0003; PI-gingivitis 0.22 [0.12, 0.31] pâ<â0.0001 and periodontitis 0.15 [0.08, 0.23] pâ<â0.0001; PD-gingivitis 0.27 [0.06; 0.48] pâ=â0.0107 and periodontitis 0.11 [0.01; 0.21] pâ=â0.0299; and CA-periodontitis 0.06 [0.01, 0.12] pâ=â0.0176.

CONCLUSIONS:
Evidence suggests a significant relationship between the severity of periodontal disease and the presence of oral lichen planus. Although the association is biologically plausible, further studies are needed using populations and well-defined biochemical and clinical outcomes with consideration of potential confounding factors.

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Is there a relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C? A meta-analysis and bioinformatics investigation.,"BACKGROUND:
The relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C was previously controversial, so our purpose is to investigate this connection.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review of the case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and hepatitis C in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and investigated the overlapping genes between psoriasis targets and hepatitis C targets using bioinformatics analysis.Â Based on overlapping genes and hub nodes, we also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module respectively, followed by the pathway enrichment analysis.

RESULTS:
We included 11 publications that reported a total of 11 studies (8 cross-sectional and 3 case-control). The case-control and cross-sectional studies included 25,047 psoriasis patients and 4,091,631 controls in total. Psoriasis was associated with a significant increase of prevalent hepatitis C (OR 1.72;Â 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.17-2.52)). A total of 389 significant genes were common to both hepatitis C and psoriasis, which mainly involved IL6, TNF, IL10, ALB, STAT3 and CXCL8. The module and pathway enrichment analyses showed that the common genes had the potential to influence varieties of biological pathways, including the inflammatory response, cytokine activity, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C and psoriasis.

CONCLUSION:
Patients with psoriasis display increased prevalence of hepatitis C and the basic related mechanisms between hepatitis C and psoriasis had been preliminarily clarified.","The relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C was previously controversial, so our purpose is to investigate this connection.","We conducted a systematic review of the case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and hepatitis C in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and investigated the overlapping genes between psoriasis targets and hepatitis C targets using bioinformatics analysis.Â Based on overlapping genes and hub nodes, we also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module respectively, followed by the pathway enrichment analysis.","We included 11 publications that reported a total of 11 studies (8 cross-sectional and 3 case-control).

Patients with psoriasis display increased prevalence of hepatitis C and the basic related mechanisms between hepatitis C and psoriasis had been preliminarily clarified."," Several studies have investigated the relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A case-control study involving 12,502 psoriasis patients and 24,287 controls found a significant association between psoriasis and HCV, with a higher prevalence of HCV in psoriasis patients compared to controls [11]. Another study found that the mRNA levels of cathelicidin, TLR9, and IFNÎ³ were significantly higher in both non-lesional and lesional skin of HCV-positive patients with psoriasis compared to HCV-negative psoriatic patients [18]. The effect of HCV treatment on psoriasis has also been explored. A prospective study of 37 HCV patients with cutaneous psoriasis found significant improvement in skin lesions following anti-HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment; however, a dramatic worsening of psoriatic lesions was observed at 24 weeks after stopping therapy [2]. Similarly, a retrospective cohort study found no cases of hepatitis or viral reactivation in 30 HCV-positive psoriasis patients undergoing biologic therapy [17]. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of 37 patients with psoriasis and chronic HCV infection treated with adalimumab found no reactivation of HCV during the follow-up period [7]. 

TL;DR: There is evidence suggesting a significant association between psoriasis and hepatitis C, and treatment of HCV may impact the course of psoriasis [2,11,17,18]. However, more research is needed to understand the complex relationship between these two conditions.

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Is oral lichen planus a risk factor for peri-implant diseases? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
To evaluate whether oral lichen planus (OLP) is a risk factor for peri-implant diseases (PIDs) with a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
Five electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched. The included studies are observational human studies written in English. The population of interest included those with/without OLP who received dental implant treatment. The follow-up time after implantation was from 1 month to 20âyears. The quality of the included articles regarding risk of bias and methodology were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data involving exposure (OLP), primary outcomes (implants having PIDs) and secondary outcomes (probing depth/PD, bleeding on probing/BOP and bone loss/BL) and potential confounders were extracted. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sup>2</sup> test. Dichotomous data are expressed as the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) which were calculated with a fixed effect model.

RESULTS:
Of the 66 articles, two studies were enrolled and evaluated as high quality, which totally contained 68 participants receiving 222 (OLP vs. non-OLP, 112 vs. 110) implants with 12 to 120-month follow-up time. Proportions of implants with PIDs between OLP and non-OLP groups were as follows: 19.6% (22/112) vs. 22.7% (25/110) for PIM and 17.0% (19/112) vs. 10.9% (12/110) for PI. The meta-analysis revealed no recognizable difference in number of implants with PIDs (PI: RRâ=â1.49, 95% CI 0.77-2.90, Pâ=â0.24; PIM:RRâ=â0.88, 95% CI 0.53-1.46, Pâ=â0.61; PIDs: RRâ=â1.08, 95% CI 0.75-1.55, Pâ=â0.68) or BOP (RRâ=â0.90, 95% CI: 0.70-1.15, Pâ=â0.40) between OLP and non-OLP groups.

CONCLUSIONS:
Available articles regarding the effects of OLP on PIDs remains very limited. Existing evidence does not support OLP as a suspected risk factor for PIDs. Large-scale prospective trials are required to validate the findings.",To evaluate whether oral lichen planus (OLP) is a risk factor for peri-implant diseases (PIDs) with a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Five electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Does cone-beam computed tomography examination increase the micronuclei frequency in the oral mucosa exfoliated cells? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
This systematic review (SR) with meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the frequency of micronuclei in the oral mucosa exfoliated cells after cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination.

METHODS:
We performed language-independent computer-assisted data searches using PubMed databases, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science all databases, and Google Scholar. The literature on micronucleus (MN) frequency of clinical trials before and after CBCT examination was included. The frequency of MN in exfoliated cells of the human oral mucosa was the primary outcome of the study. All statistical analyses were performed with R (version 4.1.0), RStudio (version 2022.02.2â+â485) software, and Meta packages (version 5.2-0). Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies by the EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project) Modified scale with minor modifications. The heterogeneity of the data was analyzed using I<sup>2</sup> statistics, in which I<sup>2</sup>â>â50% was considered substantial heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
A total of 559 articles were selected through the search strategy. After screening titles and abstracts, nine full-text manuscripts were assessed for eligibility, and six observational studies were included in the meta-analysis. The present study showed a significant increase in MN frequency of human oral mucosal exfoliated cells 10Â days after CBCT examination compared to baseline (SMDâ=â-â0.56, 95%-CIâ=â-â0.99â~â-â0.13, pâ=â0.01). Because of the high heterogeneity among the studies (I<sup>2</sup>â=â72%), after removing one study that was the main source of heterogeneity, excluding the study (I<sup>2</sup>â=â47%), the common-effect model was chosen, and the meta-analysis also showed that the frequency of MN in human oral mucosa exfoliated cells increased significantly 10Â days after CBCT examination (SMDâ=ââ-â0.35, 95%-CIâ=ââ-â0.59â~ââ-â0.11, pâ=â0.004).

CBCT examination increases the frequency of micronuclei in oral mucosal exfoliated cells."," The impact of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) on the frequency of micronuclei in oral mucosa exfoliated cells has been explored in multiple studies with varying results. One study found no significant differences in micronucleus frequency before and after CBCT exposure [1], while another study reported a statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells after both partial and total CBCT [2]. A larger study of 98 participants also found an increase in micronuclei frequency after dental radiographs, including CBCT, especially when the absorbed dose was higher than 1 mGy [3]. Studies focusing on children have shown a significant increase in micronuclei and other cytotoxic changes immediately after CBCT exposure, but these differences were not significant one month after the exposure [4]. Moreover, a study found that the field of view (FOV) during CBCT examinations can affect the level of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, with a larger FOV causing more side effects [5].

However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the long-term implications.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Do COVID-19 CT features vary between patients from within and outside mainland China? Findings from a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Chest computerized tomography (CT) plays an important role in detecting patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there are no systematic summaries on whether the chest CT findings of patients within mainland China are applicable to those found in patients outside.

METHODS:
Relevant studies were retrieved comprehensively by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases before 15 April 2022. Quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies, which were divided into two groups according to whether they were in mainland China or outside. Data on diagnostic performance, unilateral or bilateral lung involvement, and typical chest CT imaging appearances were extracted, and then, meta-analyses were performed with R software to compare the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia between patients from within and outside mainland China.

RESULTS:
Of the 8,258 studies screened, 19 studies with 3,400 patients in mainland China and 14 studies with 554 outside mainland China were included. Overall, the risk of quality assessment and publication bias was low. The diagnostic value of chest CT is similar between patients from within and outside mainland China (93, 91%). The pooled incidence of unilateral lung involvement (15, 7%), the crazy-paving sign (31, 21%), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations (51, 35%), air bronchogram (44, 25%), vascular engorgement (59, 33%), bronchial wall thickening (19, 12%), and septal thickening (39, 26%) in patients from mainland China were significantly higher than those from outside; however, the incidence rates of bilateral lung involvement (75, 84%), GGO (78, 87%), consolidations (45, 58%), nodules (12, 17%), and pleural effusion (9, 15%) were significantly lower.

CONCLUSION:
Considering that the chest CT features of patients in mainland China may not reflect those of the patients abroad, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with various CT presentations suggestive of COVID-19 in different regions.","Chest computerized tomography (CT) plays an important role in detecting patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there are no systematic summaries on whether the chest CT findings of patients within mainland China are applicable to those found in patients outside.","Relevant studies were retrieved comprehensively by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases before 15 April 2022.

China?,"Overall, the risk of quality assessment and publication bias was low. The diagnostic value of chest CT is similar between patients from within and outside mainland China (93, 91%). The pooled incidence of unilateral lung involvement (15, 7%), the crazy-paving sign (31, 21%), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations (51, 35%), air bronchogram (44, 25%), vascular engorgement (59, 33%), bronchial wall thickening (19, 12%), and septal thickening (39, 26%) in patients from mainland China were significantly higher than those from outside; however, the incidence rates of bilateral lung involvement (75, 84%), GGO (78, 87%), consolidations (45, 58%), nodules (12, 17%), and pleural effusion (9, 15%) were significantly lower.

Considering that the chest CT features of patients in mainland China may not reflect those of the patients abroad, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with various CT presentations suggestive of COVID-19 in different regions."," The studies reviewed suggest that CT features of COVID-19 patients may vary based on geographic location and exposure history. A study involving 266 patients from China and the USA found that both deep learning and radiomics models were highly sensitive and specific in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia from CT images [1]. Another study with 67 patients from Wenzhou, China, reported abnormal CT findings in 80.6% of patients [2], while a study of 37 patients from a region outside Hubei province found pneumonia in 86.5% of patients on admission [3]. A meta-analysis comparing patients from Wuhan and other areas of China found no significant differences in chest CT findings [4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1969 patients found the vascular enlargement sign (VES) in 69.37% of COVID-19 patients, with no significant differences between different countries, regions, or age groups [6]. A study of 22 patients from Nanchong, China, found more severe CT manifestations in patients with a history of exposure to Wuhan compared to those with second-generation infection [7]. 

TL;DR: The evidence suggests that while some CT features of COVID-19 may be consistent across patients, there may be variations based on geographic location and history of exposure, although some studies found no significant differences. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

For example, a study published in Radiology found that patients from outside mainland China had a higher prevalence of ground-glass opacities and consolidation on CT scans compared to patients from mainland China. Another study published in the Journal of Thoracic Imaging reported that patients from outside mainland China had a higher frequency of bilateral involvement and a lower frequency of pleural effusion on CT scans.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Can quantitative peritumoral CT radiomics features predict the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES:
To provide an overarching evaluation of the value of peritumoral CT radiomics features for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and to assess the quality of the available studies.

METHODS:
The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies predicting the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using CT-based peritumoral radiomics features. Information about the patient, CT-scanner, and radiomics analyses were all extracted for the included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies were included with 2942 patients from 2017 to 2022. Only one study was prospective, and the others were all retrospectively designed. Manual segmentation and multicenter studies were performed by 69% and 46% of the included studies, respectively. 3D-Slicer and MATLAB software were most commonly used for the segmentation of lesions and extraction of features. The peritumoral region was most frequently defined as dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm, 20 mm, or 30 mm. The median RQS of the studies was 13 (range 4-19), while all of included studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias (ROB) overall.

CONCLUSIONS:
Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images showed promise in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC, although well-designed studies and further biological validation are still needed.

Zhang 2017 explored different strategies for improving the predictive performance of radiomics-based prognosis for NSCLC, and found that Random Forest models and Principal Component Analysis were optimum predictive modeling and feature selection methods, respectively, for achieving high prognosis performance. Finally, Tang 2021 evaluated a new radiomics strategy that incorporates peritumoral and intratumoral features extracted from lung CT images with ensemble learning for pretreatment prediction of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and found that this strategy could greatly improve the diagnostic performance for the histological subtype stratification in patients with NSCLC."," Several studies have demonstrated the potential of quantitative peritumoral CT radiomics features to predict the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

","The current research on radiogenomics seeks to identify a correlation between imaging features and the predicted molecular makeup of a mass, such as a non-small cell lung carcinoma, utilizing artificial intelligence and large datasets. Furthermore, radiomics-CT scanning scoring systems help to differentiate between malignant and benign conditions, with a score of 7 or more out of 10 correlating with a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 94 percent, respectively. Quantitative peritumoral CT radiomic features may be an important prognostic indicator for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, predicting clinical outcomes. Factors such as the presence of pulmonary mass or nodule measuring more than 1 cm, pericardial effusion, absence of loculations, and age less than 15 years can play a role in determining prognosis.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Distal tibial tubercle osteotomy can lessen change in patellar height post medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is a mainstream surgical method for treating early medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Undesirable sequelae such as patella infera may happen following tuberosity osteotomy. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the change in patellar position after proximal tibial tubercle osteotomy (PTO) versus distal tibial tubercle osteotomy (DTO) intervention.

METHODS:
The 11 studies were acquired from PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library. The data were extracted by two of the coauthors independently and were analyzed by RevMan5.3. Mean differences, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess risk of bias.

RESULTS:
Eleven observational studies were assessed. The methodological quality of the trials ranged from moderate to high. The pooled results of postoperative patellar height (Caton-Deschamps index and Blackburne-Peel index) and postoperative complications showed that the differences were statistically significant between PTO and DTO interventions. Patellar index ratios decreased significantly in the PTO groups, and 12 (9.2%) complications under DTO surgery and 2 (1.6%) complications under PTO surgery were reported. The differences of postoperative posterior tibial slope (angle) was not statistically significant, but postoperative posterior tibial slope of both groups increased. Sensitivity analysis proved the stability of the pooled results and the publication bias was not apparent.

CONCLUSIONS:
DTO in MOWHTO maintained the postoperative patellar height, and clinically, for patients with serious patellofemoral osteoarthritis, DTO can be preferred. Postoperative complications are easily preventable with caution. In view of the heterogeneity and small sample size, whether these conclusions are applicable should be further determined in future studies.",Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is a mainstream surgical method for treating early medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

","Distal tibial tubercle osteotomy is a procedure performed to realign the tibial tubercle more anteriorly or medially to reduce force on the patellar cartilage. It can help reduce the pain and recurrence of patellofemoral arthritis, especially in young patients. High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) may be an alternate alternative and may indicate for unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis with malalignment. This procedure affects the mechanical weight-bearing axis of the knee by altering the coronal and sagittal planes, increases the tibial slope, and reduces the risk of posterior tibial sagging. Distal tibial tubercle osteotomy can help in lessening the change in patellar height post medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy by optimizing the condition of the patellar cartilage.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Can gray values be converted to Hounsfield units? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this systematic review was to answer the focus question: ""Could the gray values (GVs) from CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) be converted to Hounsfield units (HUs) in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)?""

METHODS:
The included studies try to answer the research question according to the PICO strategy. Studies were gathered by searching several electronic databases and partial grey literature up to January 2021 without language or time restrictions. The methodological assessment of the studies was performed using The Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) for <i>in vitro</i> studies and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) for <i>in vivo</i> studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE system) instrument was applied to assess the level of evidence across the studies.

RESULTS:
2710 articles were obtained in Phase 1, and 623 citations remained after removing duplicates. Only three studies were included in this review using a two-phase selection process and after applying the eligibility criteria. All studies were methodologically acceptable, although in general terms with low risks of bias. There are some included studies with quite low and limited evidence estimations and recommendation forces; evidencing the need for clinical studies with diagnostic capacity to support its use.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review demonstrated that the GVs from CBCT cannot be converted to HUs due to the lack of clinical studies with diagnostic capacity to support its use. However, it is evidenced that three conversion steps (equipment calibration, prediction equation models, and a standard formula (converting GVs to HUs)) are needed to obtain pseudo Hounsfield values instead of only obtaining them from a regression or directly from the software.","The purpose of this systematic review was to answer the focus question: ""Could the gray values (GVs) from CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) be converted to Hounsfield units (HUs) in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)?""","The included studies try to answer the research question according to the PICO strategy.

","Yes, gray values in CT images can be converted to Hounsfield units (HU) using a linear transformation. HU values are a relative quantitative measurement of radio density, and they are calculated based on the absorption/attenuation coefficients of radiation within a tissue.

diagnostic radiology,computed tomography,When is a Ghost Really Gone? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Accuracy of Imaging Modalities to Predict Complete Pathological Response of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases After Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND:
Administration of chemotherapy to patients with colorectal liver metastases may result in disappearing liver metastases (DLM). This poses a therapeutic dilemma due to the uncertainty of true complete (pathological) response.

OBJECTIVE:
We aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in detecting true complete response in patients with DLM after chemotherapy.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic search for articles assessing the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in evaluating DLM following chemotherapy. True complete response was defined as 1-year recurrence-free survival in non-resected patients or complete pathological response on histologic examination in resected patients. We calculated the negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting true complete response of each imaging modality using a random effects model.

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies comprising 332 patients with at least one DLM were included. The number of DLMs after chemotherapy was 955 withÂ computed tomography (CT), 104 withÂ positron emission tomography (PET), 50Â with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), 585Â with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 175 withÂ contrast-enhanced IOUS (CEIOUS). Substantial variation in study design, patient characteristics, and imaging features was observed. Pooled NPV was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.96), 0.73 (95% CI 0.58-0.85), 0.54 (95% CI 0.37-0.7), 0.47 (95% CI 0.34-0.61), and 0.22 (95% CI 0.11-0.39) for CEIOUS, MRI, IOUS, CT, and PET, respectively.

CONCLUSION:
After chemotherapy, MRI or CEIOUS are the most accurate imaging modalities for assessment of DLM and should be used routinely in this context. Given the high NPV of these two modalities, surgical resection of visible CRLM is warranted if technically possible, even if DLM remain.",We aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in detecting true complete response in patients with DLM after chemotherapy.,We performed a systematic search for articles assessing the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in evaluating DLM following chemotherapy.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Can magnetic resonance imaging enhance the assessment of potential new treatments for cognitive impairment in mood disorders? A systematic review and position paper by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Targeting Cognition Task Force.,"BACKGROUND:
Developing treatments for cognitive impairment is key to improving the functioning of people with mood disorders. Neuroimaging may assist in identifying brain-based efficacy markers. This systematic review and position paper by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Targeting Cognition Task Force examines the evidence from neuroimaging studies of pro-cognitive interventions.

METHODS:
We included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of candidate interventions in people with mood disorders or healthy individuals, following the procedures of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 statement. Searches were conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 30th April 2021. Two independent authors reviewed the studies using the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Controlled Intervention Studies and the quality of neuroimaging methodology assessment checklist.

RESULTS:

Studies have shown that MRI can identify structural and functional changes in the brain associated with mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) [2,3,4,10,14]. Specifically, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to assess brain controllability differences between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and depression, providing insights into depressive symptoms in MCI patients and potential biomarkers for diagnosing depression from MCI and Alzheimer's disease [3]. Another study used DTI to assess the integrity of white matter tracts involved in mood regulation in patients with MDD, suggesting dysfunction in the Papez Circuit [10]. Other research has shown that functional MRI (fMRI) can predict treatment outcomes in patients with major depression [7], and that fMRI response during working memory tasks may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers in patients with schizophrenia and MDD [8]. Furthermore, a study investigating the effects of psilocybin therapy on cognitive flexibility in patients with MDD found that changes in functional connectivity were associated with improvements in cognitive flexibility [9]. The use of advanced imaging techniques, such as DTI and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging, has also been suggested to potentially enhance the assessment of new treatments for cognitive impairment in mood disorders [5].

TL;DR: The available evidence suggests that MRI, particularly fMRI and DTI, can enhance the assessment of potential new treatments for cognitive impairment in mood disorders, by identifying structural and functional changes in the brain associated with these conditions, and potentially predicting treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential of other advanced imaging techniques.

Similarly, the use of erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with mood disorders was associated with an increase in subfield hippocampal volume, suggesting a potential therapeutic option for patients with impaired neuroplasticity and cognition [5]. In patients with bipolar disorder, intracortical myelin (ICM) was associated with verbal memory and other cognitive functions [2], while greater pre-treatment dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) hypoactivity predicted improvements in executive function after Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) treatment [8].

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Fetal periventricular pseudocysts: is MRI evaluation needed? What is the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with periventricular pseudocysts (PVPC) and the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these fetuses via meta-analysis.

METHODS:
MEDLINE and EMBASE database were searched for studies reporting on the MRI assessment of fetuses diagnosed with PVPC on neurosonography. The neurosonography was conducted according to the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) guidelines or standard axial, coronal and sagittal planes for advanced central nervous system (CNS) assessment. Single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences of MRI technique in three orthogonal planes were necessarily performed. The pooled proportion of CNS anomalies missed on neurosonography and detected only at prenatal MRI was calculated. Subanalysis was performed according to the types of intracranial anomalies. The pregnancy outcomes (including normal, abnormal, termination of pregnancy, and perinatal death) of PVPC fetuses were also analyzed.

RESULTS:
Five studies comprising 136 fetuses were included in this meta-analysis. Mean gestational age was 29.8Â weeks (16-38Â weeks) at ultrasonography and 31.5Â weeks (25-37Â weeks) at MRI. Overall, MRI detected exclusively CNS anomalies in 25.2% (95% CI 15.9-35.8%) of cases. Among them, the highest incidence was white matter abnormalities with the pooled proportion of 16.3% (95% CI 9.7-24.2%). When getting rid of whiteÂ matter abnormalities, the risk of associated CNS anomalies only detected on MRI was reduced to 9.1% (95% CI 1.8-21.4%). Meanwhile, 130 cases were studied to assess the pregnancy outcomes with the scope of 1Â month to 10Â years. The pooled proportion of normal outcomes in isolated PVPC fetuses was as high as 95.0% (95% CI 83.9-99.8%). When analyzing the neurodevelopmental outcomes in non-isolated PVPC fetuses, the incidence of normal neurodevelopmental outcomes was about 22.1% (95% CI 5.6-45.5%) with mild and single additional abnormalities, the rate of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes was 19.5% (95% CI 11.0-29.7%) with apparent and/or multiple abnormalities. Besides, 53.6% (95% CI 35.4-71.3%) of non-isolated PVPC cases were terminated mainly due to infections, genetic anomalies, metabolic disorders and hemorrhage.

CONCLUSIONS:
MRI assessment of PVPC fetuses is recommended to detect associated intracranial anomalies that may be missed on dedicated neurosonography. White matter abnormalities on MRI account for the majority of additional anomalies, which might to be the clue of CMV infection, aminoacidopathy or white matter disease. Moreover, the neurodevelopmental outcome of isolated PVPC fetuses remains favorable, while the neurodevelopmental outcomes of non-isolated PVPC fetuses depend on the accompanying anomaly.",To explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with periventricular pseudocysts (PVPC) and the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these fetuses via meta-analysis.,"MEDLINE and EMBASE database were searched for studies reporting on the MRI assessment of fetuses diagnosed with PVPC on neurosonography.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,A meta-analysis on neural changes of cognitive training for mental disorders in executive function tasks: increase or decrease brain activation?,"BACKGROUND:
Cognitive impairment is often found in patients with psychiatric disorders, and cognitive training (CT) has been shown to help these patients. To better understand the mechanisms of CT, many neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural changes associated with it. However, the results of those studies have been inconsistent, making it difficult to draw conclusions from the literature. Therefore, the objective of this meta-analysis was to identify consistent patterns in the literature of neural changes associated with CT for psychiatric disorders.

METHODS:
We searched for cognitive training imaging studies in PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus, and ProQuest electronic databases. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, conduct behavioral analysis of brain regions identified by ALE analysis, conduct behavioral analysis of brain regions identified by ALE analysis, and then created a functional meta-analytic connectivity model (fMACM) of the resulting regions.

RESULTS:
Results showed that CT studies consistently reported increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and decreased activation in the left precuneus and cuneus from pre- to post- CT.

CONCLUSION:
CT improves cognitive function by supporting language and memory function, and reducing neuronal resources associated with basic visual processing.","Cognitive impairment is often found in patients with psychiatric disorders, and cognitive training (CT) has been shown to help these patients.

CT improves cognitive function by supporting language and memory function, and reducing neuronal resources associated with basic visual processing."," Cognitive training for mental disorders in executive function tasks has shown varied effects on brain activation. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 34 older adults with mild cognitive impairment demonstrated that virtual reality-based training led to improvements in executive function and decreased activation in prefrontal areas, suggesting increased neural efficiency [1]. Similarly, a systematic review with meta-analysis involving 2,221 participants showed that dual-task training had a positive effect on cognitive functions including executive function [2]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis, however, found insufficient high-quality evidence to conclude the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function in adults with stroke or other non-progressive acquired brain injuries [5]. A study involving 100 participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) found that resistance exercise led to long-term cognitive improvements and neuroprotective effects, but cognitive training did not show the same neuroprotective effects [4]. The review article [3] discussed the potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in promoting synaptic plasticity and improving cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but it did not provide specific evidence related to cognitive training.

TL;DR: Cognitive training for mental disorders in executive function tasks may improve cognitive performance and potentially lead to increased neural efficiency, but the evidence is mixed and further high-quality research is needed.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Is radiomic MRI a feasible alternative to OncotypeDXÂ® recurrence score testing? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
OncotypeDXÂ® recurrence score (RS) aids therapeutic decision-making in oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Radiomics is an evolving field that aims to examine the relationship between radiological features and the underlying genomic landscape of disease processes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of current evidence evaluating the comparability of radiomics and RS.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing radiomic MRI tumour analyses and RS were identified. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) delineating low risk (RS less than 18) versus intermediate-high risk (equal to or greater than 18) and low-intermediate risk (RS less than 30) and high risk (RS greater than 30) were recorded. Log rate ratios (lnRR) and standard error were determined from AUC and 95 per cent confidence intervals.

RESULTS:
Nine studies including 1216 patients met inclusion criteria; the mean age at diagnosis was 52.9 years. Mean RS was 16 (range 0-75); 401 patients with RS less than 18, 287 patients with RS 18-30 and 100 patients with RS greater than 30. Radiomic analysis and RS were comparable for differentiating RS less than 18 versus RS 18 or greater (RR 0.93 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 1.01); P = 0.010, heterogeneity (I2)=0%) as well as RS less than 30 versus RS 30 or greater (RR 0.76 (95 per cent c.i. 0.70 to 0.83); P < 0.001, I2=0%). MRI sensitivity and specificity for RS less than 18 versus 18 or greater was 0.89 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 0.93) and 0.72 (95 per cent c.i. 0.66 to 0.78) respectively, and 0.79 (95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 0.86) and 0.74 (95 per cent c.i. 0.68 to 0.80) for RS less than 30 versus 30 or greater.

","No. Radiomics MRI is not a suitable alternative to recurrence score testing with the OncotypeDx assay. The OncotypeDx assay is an ASCO-approved quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which evaluates 21-genes to obtain a recurrence score which predicts the course of a specific breast mass. MRI is more sensitive at detecting tumor regrowth, however, it is costly and requires anesthesia. There is no available radiological test which can provide 100% accuracy or reliability. The ProtecT trial demonstrated that there is no detriment to 10-year survival in offering active surveillance over primary radical treatment, although the patient does entail the risk of disease progression in opting for active surveillance. Autosegmentation, model-based automated target delineation, and omics driven radiation therapy are recommended treatment approaches for the future.",0.6727837324142456,0.08666666666666667,0.1171875,27.06015165464471,0.03740648379052369,0.8635049105236599,0.0,0.5266899221774304,0.21744831617590965,0.6645109057426453,0.09210526315789476,0.12395107373332931,26.580950886500094,0.04239401496259352,0.877339546682127,0.0,0.4950858424224797,0.2056631014000405,0.735252857208252,0.10027855153203342,0.13908720210180686,23.953734984321787,0.06319290465631928,1.0,0.0,0.5087317705602574,0.2560146565671542,0.7378329634666443,0.11501597444089458,0.14145496535796767,28.51727736554373,0.059850374064837904,0.8929001203369434,0.0,0.5230863162534154,0.2577548356794174,0.6630367636680603,0.0639269406392694,0.13996889580093314,27.09184507571434,0.0199501246882793,0.8219890269024455,0.0,0.4979615405201912,0.19649756199946716,0.7034643888473511,0.09584664536741214,0.12951807228915665,23.262223178881612,0.05610972568578554,0.9073405535499398,0.0,0.4859037052786521,0.2356101526719034,0.7036969661712646,0.09420289855072465,0.1354581673306773,27.00940674614392,0.04239401496259352,0.8017198154833534,0.0,0.49389931756929056,0.23556270803439527,0.658172070980072,0.05714285714285715,0.12658227848101267,21.568900873109456,0.016209476309226933,0.825511432009627,0.0,0.48421394600058504,0.18977059638742555,0.7115284204483032,0.1183431952662722,0.13186221743810547,25.256041846878414,0.06483790523690773,0.9866503131846092,0.0,0.5111239842643822,0.2445050845748362,0.7125164270401001,0.1212121212121212,0.1530572270114645,29.66557934685547,0.05610972568578554,0.8862309852201549,0.0,0.5210797682584051,0.24290305330792333,0.6801120638847351,0.07476635514018692,0.12259194395796849,26.297555695832813,0.014962593516209476,0.850804682188141,0.0,0.5241771952382156,0.20710239261874974,0.700766921043396,0.1412639405204461,0.15088808318249777,32.796504479259454,0.04987531172069826,0.7581059590968185,0.0,0.5216983931123718,0.23398636627616942,0.6954421401023865,0.05863192182410423,0.12732278045423262,24.42722169324448,0.03740648379052369,0.8986372368948846,0.0,0.48491362038444963,0.22283905138824536
diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Diagnostic capabilities of transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) to evaluate anal sphincter defect post obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS)? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
Endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) is the gold standard imaging investigation for evaluating the anal sphincter; unfortunately, it is not universally available in most obstetric units. This study aims to appraise the ability of transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) compared with 3D-EAUS as the gold standard to identify anal sphincter defects after primary repair of OASIS.

METHODS:
A systematic search of major databases to identify diagnostic accuracy of 3D-TPUS in evaluating anal sphincter defects. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were designed for this systematic review. The risk of bias and applicability concerns were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our eligibility criteria are patients with a history of primary repair of anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). They were followed up after the primary repair to detect the anal sphincter defect using 3D-TPUS vs. 3D-EAUS as a gold standard.

RESULTS:
Two eligible observational studies were included and assessed for risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool and showed a low risk of bias and a low risk of concerns. 3D-TPUS had various sensitivity to detect external anal sphincter defects in two studies; meanwhile, the specificity was around 67-70%. For detecting the internal anal sphincter defects, 3D-TPUS had low sensitivity but high specificity (93-94%).

CONCLUSION:
3D-TPUS had various sensitivity to detect external anal sphincter defects and low sensitivity to detect internal anal sphincter defects. On the other hand, 3D-TPUS had low specificity for detecting external anal sphincter defects and high specificity for detecting internal anal sphincter defects.","Endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) is the gold standard imaging investigation for evaluating the anal sphincter; unfortunately, it is not universally available in most obstetric units.

Several studies have shown that TPUS can effectively assess OASIS, with good agreement with endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), the gold standard for diagnosing such injuries [3,10,11,14,15]. However, one study found that TPUS may have poor to moderate agreement with EAUS in measuring defect size, suggesting a risk of incorrect diagnosis of significant defects [11]. Some studies have also found correlations between the severity of anal incontinence symptoms and the presence and size of residual defects detected by TPUS [9,14].

Furthermore, a study found that the use of four abnormal slices on TPUS as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of significant EAS trauma [12].

TL;DR: Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) can effectively diagnose anal sphincter defects post obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS), with good agreement with endoanal ultrasound (EAUS).

It can provide detailed images of the anal sphincter muscles and surrounding tissues, allowing for the identification of any abnormalities or defects.

Studies have shown that TPUS has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting anal sphincter defects. It can accurately identify both external and internal anal sphincter defects, and can also provide information about the size and location of the defect. This can be particularly useful in guiding treatment decisions and assessing the likelihood of successful surgical repair.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of TPUS can be influenced by several factors, including the skill and experience of the operator, the quality of the ultrasound equipment, and the patient's body habitus. Therefore, it is important that TPUS is performed by a trained professional using high-quality equipment.

In conclusion, TPUS is a valuable tool for evaluating anal sphincter defects post OASIS. It provides a non-invasive, accurate, and detailed assessment of the anal sphincter muscles, which can aid in diagnosis and treatment planning.","Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating anal sphincter defects post obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS). TPUS allows for visualization of the anal sphincter complex, including the external anal sphincter and the internal anal sphincter.

TPUS is a non-invasive and well-tolerated procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. It provides real-time imaging and can be used to assess the integrity and function of the anal sphincter muscles. TPUS has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in detecting anal sphincter defects, making it a valuable tool in the evaluation of OASIS.","The papers suggest that transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) can improve the diagnosis of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS).

","Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) is a valuable diagnostic tool for the assessment of anal sphincter defects post obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS). Using TPUS, the perineum can be assessed to estimate the distance between the rectal pouch and the perineum. TPUS also allows for visualization of the dilated urethra in posterior urethral valves, and occasionally a valve itself can be seen in real time. This helps to accurately diagnose OASIS and the extent of the injury. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging is supplanting transrectal imaging for the evaluation of the prostate and seminal vesicles, which is important to consider in the diagnosis of OASIS.",0.8261661529541016,0.23170731707317077,0.1526793010476456,25.765861666691634,0.07782101167315175,1.0,0.0,0.5711001130502399,0.3202587588481008,0.806194543838501,0.18803418803418803,0.0986814478877971,18.171573835996877,0.05875299760191847,1.0,0.0,0.5161371542537798,0.30442134699824563,0.7412912249565125,0.12499999999999999,0.06411467316817111,13.19329057614146,0.031683168316831684,1.0,0.0,0.4462421220115253,0.26825030563767066,0.742984414100647,0.1278538812785388,0.0878894645941278,15.75869754684642,0.036193029490616625,1.0,0.0,0.4391486275628323,0.2660889026787702,0.7898718118667603,0.18947368421052632,0.1392273327241344,29.855463401463645,0.06611570247933884,0.8699494949494949,0.0,0.522968541426831,0.28729049892927455,0.7703194618225098,0.1550387596899225,0.07317676908320184,14.29937726866164,0.03757225433526012,1.0,0.0,0.4873778741938508,0.2884100757954624,0.7764331698417664,0.15178571428571427,0.09253475624360395,16.868268366469906,0.04252873563218391,1.0,0.0,0.49258991872986,0.2904384754421311,0.800197958946228,0.18421052631578946,0.1631136950904393,28.998017065441516,0.06896551724137931,0.7631874298540965,0.0,0.5411795377731323,0.2901418921565462,0.7695713043212891,0.13521126760563382,0.07394803368985328,13.198618215867777,0.0416116248348745,1.0,0.0,0.48093484546623977,0.2920593874354159,0.7761291265487671,0.15584415584415584,0.08557996666104774,15.359473172213967,0.04773082942097027,1.0,0.0,0.48664161586082044,0.29493489125537314,0.782646656036377,0.22471910112359547,0.17762660619803478,28.511233916103663,0.07476635514018691,0.9565095398428731,0.0,0.5055847593090114,0.2802775919737455,0.7647488117218018,0.15028901734104047,0.07575757575757575,17.667926988036292,0.03728813559322034,1.0,0.0,0.47292745464973235,0.2725642996392777,0.7704464197158813,0.1506849315068493,0.09368312757201647,17.934225439788857,0.04185022026431718,1.0,0.0,0.476655648366825,0.2694318491172312
diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Is carotid artery atherosclerosis associated with poor cognitive function assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:
To determine associations between carotid atherosclerosis assessed by ultrasound and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a measure of global cognitive function.

DESIGN:
Systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to 1 May 2020 to identify studies assessed the associations between asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis and the MMSE. Studies reporting OR for associations between carotid plaque or intima-media thickness (cIMT) and dichotomised MMSE were meta-analysed. Publication bias of included studies was assessed.

RESULTS:
A total of 31 of 378 reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria; together they included 27 738 participants (age 35-95 years). Fifteen studies reported some evidence of a positive association between measures of atherosclerosis and poorer cognitive performance in either cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. The remaining 16 studies found no evidence of an association. Seven cross-sectional studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of three studies that assessed carotid plaque (n=3549) showed an association between the presence of plaque and impaired MMSE with pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 2.72 (0.85 to 4.59). An association between cIMT and impaired MMSE was reported in six studies (n=4443) with a pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 1.13 (1.04 to 1.22). Heterogeneity across studies was moderate to small (carotid plaque with MMSE, I<sup>2</sup>=40.9%; cIMT with MMSE, I<sup>2</sup>=4.9%). There was evidence of publication bias for carotid plaque studies (p=0.02), but not cIMT studies (p=0.2).

CONCLUSIONS:
There is some, limited cross-sectional evidence indicating an association between cIMT and poorer global cognitive function assessed with MMSE. Estimates of the association between plaques and poor cognition are too imprecise to draw firm conclusions and evidence from studies of longitudinal associations between carotid atherosclerosis and MMSE is limited.

"," Evidence from several studies, particularly those with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs, suggests that carotid artery atherosclerosis is associated with poor cognitive function as assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. However, the strength of this association varies across studies, and potential biases in some studies should be considered.

"," Multiple studies have indicated a significant association between carotid artery atherosclerosis and poor cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A large cohort study involving 4006 right-handed men and women aged 65 years or older found that high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery was associated with cognitive impairment and decline, even after adjusting for vascular risk factors [1]. Similar findings were reported in a study involving 384 patients aged â¥80 years, where lower carotid artery wall shear stress, indicative of atherosclerosis, was associated with cognitive impairment [2]. A cross-sectional study involving 210 adults aged 60 years and older in Uganda found an association between the presence of carotid artery plaque and abnormal cognitive function [3]. A meta-analysis involving 27,738 participants from 31 studies found an association between carotid plaque and impaired MMSE [6]. A longitudinal study involving 66 patients with Alzheimer's disease found that increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque index (PI) were associated with increased cognitive impairment [7]. A cross-sectional study involving 2,794 participants from the Beaver Dam Offspring Study found that larger IMT was associated with lower scores on the MMSE [12]. 

"," There is substantial evidence from multiple studies, including large cohort studies and a meta-analysis, to suggest that carotid artery atherosclerosis is associated with poorer cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination.

","The evidence indicates that carotid artery atherosclerosis is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, as assessed through the Mini-Mental State Examination. To protect against stroke and transient ischemic attacks, treatments such as carotid endarterectomy, antiplatelet agents, warfarin, or physical exercise can slow down the progression of the disease. Factors that contribute to carotid artery stenosis include smoking, high lipid profile, male gender, and age. Studies from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trials showed that carotid endarterectomy could benefit those with severe stenosis, but was not recommended for those with less than 50% stenosis. Therefore, carotid endarterectomy is suggested for those with 50% or more stenosis and symptoms such as amaurosis fugax, a painless temporary loss of vision, hemiparesis, facial weakness, and speech loss.",0.751352846622467,0.1386138613861386,0.22135416666666669,39.22956652336797,0.05521472392638037,0.7557153827075702,0.0,0.6306058703445074,0.2741424341165666,0.7321509122848511,0.09486166007905138,0.19786910197869104,31.34652633227459,0.024539877300613498,0.8710129957932692,0.0,0.6267304889491347,0.25074776517484737,0.7872991561889648,0.17142857142857146,0.2256301976113453,42.98867913822061,0.11247443762781185,0.9261996217757936,0.0,0.6232564927124586,0.30775614037695576,0.783295750617981,0.1692307692307692,0.2277277277277277,44.48229773622383,0.09918200408997956,0.8547451636904763,0.0,0.6174944256195097,0.30375529166139675,0.7397187352180481,0.08438818565400845,0.22671130952380958,27.456739323051714,0.02147239263803681,0.86640625,0.0,0.6738913308929753,0.2633779800114779,0.7851824760437012,0.152073732718894,0.2300995024875622,40.15081024899248,0.10224948875255624,1.0,0.0,0.6145358707223619,0.3069831944477331,0.7837703824043274,0.15706806282722513,0.25703526950672445,42.070484711764834,0.081799591002045,0.8232068452380952,0.0,0.6161210501823968,0.30496844738852524,0.7496042251586914,0.11583011583011582,0.23319615912208508,36.460380412621824,0.032719836400818,0.8272265624999999,0.0,0.6158846062608063,0.26074765250032417,0.7938330173492432,0.1923937360178971,0.2517637703367625,41.307067088610395,0.12282398452611218,1.0,0.0,0.6293301336421557,0.31274514340425213,0.7907088994979858,0.19024390243902442,0.279277685336084,42.810513231280304,0.1165644171779141,0.8928345114087302,0.0,0.6304386499589377,0.3108476002401184,0.7516683340072632,0.10655737704918034,0.24983512544802877,32.975169382320495,0.026584867075664622,0.8790214082792207,0.0,0.6460147842447809,0.2632353471913827,0.7965319752693176,0.1899441340782123,0.278314141112035,48.64548816504759,0.12474437627811862,0.9143005952380954,0.0,0.6755432902614852,0.31616471744428415,0.7240241169929504,0.125,0.18304431599229284,33.805219479500096,0.05214723926380368,0.7838904436152571,0.0,0.5381331004826306,0.2541480822380804
diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Are patients recovering from Kawasaki disease at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Recent studies have suggested that Kawasaki disease (KD) may cause endothelial dysfunction, which can potentially induce atherosclerosis. However, there is still no consensus on the relationship between KD and atherosclerosis. This article aimed to determine whether patients with a history of KD may be at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis via a meta-analysis.

METHODS:
The PubMed, Embase, and SpringerLink databases were systematically searched. Studies on risk factors for atherosclerosis were included. A meta-analysis of case-control studies was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.

RESULTS:
Twenty studies were included with a total of 1684 subjects (990 patients after KD and 694 controls). The meta-analysis showed that the level of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03; Pâ=â0.005) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (95% CI: 0.00, 0.10; Pâ=â0.03) were significantly higher in patients after KD than controls, whereas flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) (95% CI: -â5.14, -â1.26; Pâ=â0.001) in patients after KD was significantly lower. There were no significant differences in total cholesterol (TC) (95% CI: -â0.13, 5.92; Pâ=â0.06), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (95% CI: -â0.65, 2.08; Pâ=â0.31), or triglycerides (TG) (95% CI: -â1.94, 8.03; Pâ=â0.23).

","Patients recovering from Kawasaki disease are at an increased risk of developing accelerated atherosclerosis due to the formation of aneurysms, heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, and valvulitis, as well as the risk of MI and sudden death. Approximately 9% of patients will experience acute phase cardiac complications, while about 3% will experience cardiac sequelae, such as mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation. Research has shown that approximately 15-25% of untreated children go on to develop coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs). Treatment aims at minimizing the risk of CAA formation by decreasing inflammation of the coronary arteries. This includes high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 10-12 hours, as well as high dose aspirin (ASA) at 80 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day divided every six hours until the patient has been afebrile for over 48 hours.

diagnostic radiology,mammography,Is single reading with computer-aided detection (CAD) as good as double reading in mammography screening? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
In accordance with European guidelines, mammography screening comprises independent readings by two breast radiologists (double reading). CAD (computer-aided detection) has been suggested to complement or replace one of the two readers (single readingâ+âCAD).The aim of this systematic review is to address the following question: Is the reading of mammographic x-ray images by a single breast radiologist together with CAD at least as accurate as double reading?

METHODS:
The electronic literature search included the databases Pub Med, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers assessed abstracts and full-text articles.

RESULTS:
1049 abstracts were identified, of which 996 were excluded with reference to inclusion and exclusion criteria; 53 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, four articles were included in the qualitative analysis, and one in a GRADE synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS:
The scientific evidence is insufficient to determine whether the accuracy of single readingâ+âCAD is at least equivalent to that obtained in standard practice, i.e. double reading where two breast radiologists independently read the mammographic images.","In accordance with European guidelines, mammography screening comprises independent readings by two breast radiologists (double reading).

","Mammography remains the gold standard for screening of breast cancer, but its effectiveness is limited by its inability to accurately detect abnormalities in dense tissue. To address this limitation, digital mammography, tomosynthesis, and screening MRI may be used to more effectively detect cancer.

diagnostic radiology,fluoroscopy,Does less invasive spine surgery result in increased radiation exposure? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Radiation exposure to patients and spine surgeons during spine surgery is expected. The risks of radiation exposure include thyroid cancer, cataracts, and lymphoma. Although imaging techniques facilitate less invasive approaches and improve intraoperative accuracy, they may increase radiation exposure.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
We performed a systematic review to determine whether (1) radiation exposure differs in open spine procedures compared with less invasive spine procedures; (2) radiation exposure differs in where the surgeon is positioned in relation to the C-arm; and (3) if radiation exposure differs using standard C-arm fluoroscopy or fluoroscopy with computer-assisted navigation.

METHODS:
A PubMed search was performed from January 1980 to July 2013 for English language articles relating to radiation exposure in spine surgery. Twenty-two relevant articles met inclusion criteria. Level of evidence was assigned on clinical studies. Traditional study quality evaluation of nonclinical studies was not applicable.

RESULTS:
There are important risks of radiation exposure in spine surgery to both the surgeon and patient. There is increased radiation exposure in less invasive spine procedures, but the use of protective barriers decreases radiation exposure. Where the surgeon stands in relation to the image source is important. Increasing the distance between the location of the C-arm radiation source and the surgeon, and standing contralateral from the C-arm radiation source, decreases radiation exposure. The use of advanced imaging modalities such as CT or three-dimensional computer-assisted navigation can potentially decrease radiation exposure.

CONCLUSIONS:
There is increased radiation exposure during less invasive spine surgery, which affects the surgeon, patient, and operating room personnel. Being cognizant of radiation exposure risks, the spine surgeon can potentially minimize radiation risks by optimizing variables such as the use of barriers, knowledge of position, distance from the radiation source, and use of advanced image guidance navigation-assisted technology to minimize radiation exposure. Continued research is important to study the long-term risk of radiation exposure and its relationship to cancer, which remains a major concern and needs further study as the popularity of less invasive spine surgery increases.","Radiation exposure to patients and spine surgeons during spine surgery is expected.

diagnostic radiology,fluoroscopy,Do Epidural Injections Provide Short- and Long-term Relief for Lumbar Disc Herniation? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
As part of a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, epidural injections often are used in the management of lumbar disc herniation. Recent guidelines and systematic reviews have reached different conclusions about the efficacy of epidural injections in managing lumbar disc herniation.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review, we determined the efficacy (pain relief and functional improvement) of the three anatomic approaches (caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal) for epidural injections in the treatment of disc herniation.

METHODS:
We performed a literature search from 1966 to June 2013 in PubMed, Cochrane library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, previous systematic reviews, and cross-references for trials studying all types of epidural injections in managing chronic or chronic and subacute lumbar disc herniation. We wanted only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (either placebo or active controlled) to be included in our analysis, and 66 studies found in our search fulfilled these criteria. We then assessed the methodologic quality of these 66 studies using the Cochrane review criteria for RCTs. Thirty-nine studies were excluded, leaving 23 RCTs of high and moderate methodologic quality for analysis. Evidence for the efficacy of all three approaches for epidural injection under fluoroscopy was strong for short-term (<Â 6Â months) and moderate for long-term (â¥Â 6Â months) based on the Cochrane rating system with five levels of evidence (best evidence synthesis), with strong evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple high-quality RCTs and moderate evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple low-quality RCTs or one high-quality RCT. The primary outcome measure was pain relief, defined as at least 50% improvement in pain or 3-point improvement in pain scores in at least 50% of the patients. The secondary outcome measure was functional improvement, defined as 50% reduction in disability or 30% reduction in the disability scores.

RESULTS:
Based on strong evidence for short-term efficacy from multiple high-quality trials and moderate evidence for long-term efficacy from at least one high quality trial, we found that fluoroscopic caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections were efficacious at managing lumbar disc herniation in terms of pain relief and functional improvement.

CONCLUSIONS:
The available evidence suggests that epidural injections performed under fluoroscopy by trained physicians offer improvement in pain and function in well-selected patients with lumbar disc herniation.","As part of a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, epidural injections often are used in the management of lumbar disc herniation.

","Epidural injections may be used as an initial management of choice in acute lumbar disc herniation, with evidence showing good efficacy in the short term after 2-4 weeks. Transforaminal or interlaminar epidural steroid injections can provide short-term (2-4 weeks) pain relief but the effects are often not lasting and a longer duration of management may be necessary. There is good evidence of efficacy for lumbar disc herniations, fair for spinal stenosis and poor for failed back surgery syndrome. Research suggests that two-level transforaminal epidural steroid injections may provide better pain relief than one level, though the duration of pain relief is still short. Overall, epidermal injections may provide short-term relief, but they are unlikely to provide long-term relief for lumbar disc herniation.",0.8245965242385864,0.2247191011235955,0.24034914661339388,41.66209170776025,0.13681592039800994,0.8347369976359338,0.0,0.6545263838580274,0.32418926238827306,0.7853911519050598,0.1789473684210526,0.17537059283357667,36.35538708647884,0.07346938775510205,0.969596420128335,0.0,0.5792641994800973,0.29515453861273394,0.7566378116607666,0.18852459016393444,0.12168224299065422,29.850186966609265,0.05934065934065934,1.0,0.0,0.49275472352259964,0.27840918011972726,0.7435557246208191,0.18867924528301888,0.12034889317753625,31.49985015419679,0.06135770234986945,1.0,0.0,0.4619919081157613,0.2653633339054313,0.8263910412788391,0.21818181818181814,0.39808086924344865,39.36582621493343,0.06918238993710692,0.8293024108698439,0.0,0.6830783134157007,0.314387780628229,0.7947607040405273,0.1695906432748538,0.11046749904961306,23.78489384762276,0.06891271056661562,1.0,0.0,0.5517422141598873,0.308756016487701,0.7855864763259888,0.15894039735099338,0.11628546420616909,26.47793074583204,0.06878306878306878,1.0,0.0,0.530972847285179,0.3009047643418041,0.8565430045127869,0.2542372881355932,0.4801894918173989,54.28143797287359,0.14779874213836477,0.823544621749409,0.0,0.7550643692756521,0.34773920249558044,0.813772439956665,0.22775800711743768,0.15591383889298,29.142683441775247,0.0988235294117647,1.0,0.0,0.5955047600076232,0.31784171783729415,0.811037003993988,0.2479338842975207,0.1823258703954414,33.09075721620753,0.11078717201166181,1.0,0.0,0.5923786340972742,0.31545400240717325,0.8342694044113159,0.2564102564102564,0.3877477332905399,42.724138883743734,0.09119496855345911,0.7640252773231496,0.0,0.6871986144781113,0.32947648587319817,0.8664414882659912,0.2571428571428571,0.25359313709814957,42.829081882722484,0.21561338289962825,1.0,0.0,0.7014164296435375,0.36356709528732956,0.8324580788612366,0.19230769230769232,0.20181844695926318,38.59116450667484,0.09523809523809523,1.0,0.0,0.6551612281537318,0.3299633107837806
diagnostic radiology,musculoskeletal radiology,Does Artificial Intelligence Outperform Natural Intelligence in Interpreting Musculoskeletal Radiological Studies? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that enables computers to abstract patterns from data without explicit programming. A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
This systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

RESULTS:
ML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p < 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p < 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images.

CONCLUSIONS:
At present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.

Findings from MRIs may provide some guidance for clinicians and patients, though natural intelligence is still more dependable in interpreting radiological studies.",0.7458439469337463,0.10352941176470588,0.2103896103896104,39.197236428154696,0.060653188180404355,0.805759457933371,0.0,0.599036456924854,0.2668752215139079,0.7570672035217285,0.06896551724137931,0.19247219846022243,37.22964791915533,0.03421461897356143,0.7899491812535291,0.0,0.639444769474498,0.26647375745867125,0.7516490817070007,0.12830188679245283,0.16805324459234608,37.0670470390702,0.08087091757387248,0.8777853634299962,0.0,0.5927851814619253,0.282097999794982,0.7477248907089233,0.13279678068410464,0.1777086628963246,37.63032237421013,0.07465007776049767,0.8173103619004031,0.0,0.5914225123532406,0.2793848881473692,0.720341682434082,0.04651162790697674,0.12903225806451615,22.50183263585277,0.01088646967340591,0.8983625070581592,0.0,0.6256090927691687,0.2415802313610094,0.7895451188087463,0.1317829457364341,0.2235095424945196,39.872941881003676,0.09175738724727839,0.8306417393945997,0.0,0.6144754861282113,0.30323382703549995,0.7907481789588928,0.1398305084745763,0.24901670478106228,40.66544064624184,0.08475894245723173,0.7957841359085257,0.0,0.6215085828865784,0.3023724417543531,0.7364766001701355,0.0641025641025641,0.15109890109890112,26.888738343931486,0.015552099533437015,0.8631308024634617,0.0,0.6305054302016894,0.2562452456080304,0.7836723923683167,0.12095032397408206,0.2378374945628534,44.85577310136985,0.08475894245723173,0.8474671615023939,0.0,0.6228523991948409,0.2973747808221041,0.7822535634040833,0.11655011655011654,0.25527826032147566,44.55005573267639,0.07387247278382582,0.7997567649741564,0.0,0.626561721909939,0.2963167911746569,0.7282221913337708,0.059602649006622516,0.15455950540958271,27.57440002439874,0.014774494556765163,0.8802936194240542,0.0,0.6152590636325919,0.24434029225136877,0.7867423295974731,0.2369668246445498,0.2998818947745851,52.032285957784765,0.1368584758942457,0.7339537678558993,0.0,0.6803554777801036,0.3021444459625621,0.751226544380188,0.09819121447028423,0.20872452768242844,40.63596637266815,0.04121306376360809,0.7815347977766768,0.0,0.6167734115412741,0.2706586484459495
diagnostic radiology,abdominal radiology,Is contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) superior to computed tomography angiography (CTA) in detection of endoleaks in post-EVAR patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the detection of endoleaks within endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) surveillance at time of follow up.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search was undertaken among the four major databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Ovid) to identify all articles assessing diagnostic specificity and accuracy with comparative modality (CEUS vs CTA) for endoleaks in adult patients at time of follow-up following EVAR. Databases where evaluated and assessed to October 2018.

RESULTS:
A total of 1773 patients were analysed from across 18 included studies in the quantitative analysis of the parameters of interest. There was no significant difference in detection rate of endoleak type I with detection rate 4.3% for both groups OR 1.09, 95% CI [0.78, 1.53], pâ=â0.62; type II endoleak detection rate was 22% in the CEUS group vs 23% in the CTA group OR 1.16, 95% CI [0.75-1.79], pâ=â0.50; while type III detection rate was 1.8% in CEUS group vs 2% in CTA group OR 0.85, 95% CI [0.43, 1.68], pâ=â0.64. However, the sensitivity rate for endoleak detection was higher in CEUS (pâ=â0.001) while no difference in specificity rate was noted (pâ=â0.28). There was higher rate of missed endoleaks in CTA groups (nâ=â12 vs nâ=â20).

CONCLUSION:
Evidences from this study suggest that contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan post-EVAR can be utilised as safe and effective method in screening for endoleaks during post-EVAR surveillance without exposing the patient for additional risk of radiation and contrast.

However, it's not accurate to categorically state that one is superior to the other. The choice between CEUS and CTA often depends on the specific circumstances of the patient and the preferences of the medical team.

CEUS involves the injection of a contrast agent into the patient's bloodstream, which enhances the ultrasound images and improves the visualization of blood flow. CTA, on the other hand, uses X-rays and a contrast agent to create detailed images of blood vessels.

Several studies have compared the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS and CTA in detecting endoleaks in post-EVAR patients. While both modalities have shown good sensitivity and specificity, there is currently no consensus on which is superior.

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2019 concluded that CEUS and CTA have similar diagnostic accuracy in detecting endoleaks. However, the review also noted that CEUS may be more useful in certain scenarios, such as in patients with renal insufficiency or iodine allergy, where CTA may be contraindicated.

It is important to note that the choice between CEUS and CTA should be based on individual patient factors, availability of resources, and the expertise of the interpreting physician. A multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and sonographers is often recommended to optimize the detection and management of endoleaks in post-EVAR patients.","The papers suggest that contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a safe and effective alternative to computed tomography angiography (CTA) for detecting endoleaks in post-endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) patients. Harky 2019 found that CEUS had a higher sensitivity rate for endoleak detection than CTA, while Cantisani 2011 and Perini 2011 found that CEUS had similar accuracy to CTA in detecting endoleaks.

","Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a safe and effective diagnostic imaging tool that is gaining popularity in academic institutions due to its lack of renal injury compared to CT or MRI. CEUS is largely used to characterize lesions detected on a non-contrast ultrasound, and has high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (97%) detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it has yet to be proven superior to computed tomography angiography (CTA) in terms of detecting endoleaks in post-EVAR patients. A 2017 Cochrane review suggests CEUS has a superior sensitivity and specificity (82%-91% and 93%-96%, respectively) than CDUS for detecting endoleaks, but further research is needed to determine its efficacy compared to CTA.",0.7899803519248962,0.14503816793893132,0.05993545412632549,14.971229011961979,0.03640256959314775,1.0,0.0,0.5246802285557888,0.2953323269720583,0.8251671195030212,0.2040816326530612,0.18546935021790292,31.01035800341992,0.0746606334841629,1.0,0.0,0.5789392265107702,0.31768887212138813,0.8011652231216431,0.17813765182186234,0.1050932170807838,17.73624238303815,0.049019607843137254,1.0,0.0,0.5688113781443813,0.31069579038438655,0.8136268854141235,0.1932367149758454,0.10821875853314734,20.113269162938828,0.05785123966942149,1.0,0.0,0.5921028583709683,0.3190775683440967,0.8369104862213135,0.2619047619047619,0.32484092436605294,46.77989139112667,0.12643678160919541,0.6463022508038585,0.0,0.6107250007667712,0.3197979079355087,0.7899668216705322,0.14062500000000003,0.0767755661935556,16.023116374372012,0.0306553911205074,1.0,0.0,0.5386389885221096,0.30137040154570954,0.7950136065483093,0.16589861751152074,0.08852496031983209,18.258979997518495,0.03524804177545692,1.0,0.0,0.5482697351031514,0.3044677145862286,0.8248015642166138,0.16867469879518074,0.1811594202898551,34.00413609374875,0.07471264367816093,0.7341420637240573,0.0,0.6106026439617077,0.3121187101592757,0.7868281602859497,0.14332247557003258,0.0692011108987473,14.281448387608261,0.034782608695652174,1.0,0.0,0.5199740573516867,0.2988298058715283,0.7813278436660767,0.15037593984962408,0.0784879861940794,14.700799879737737,0.031055900621118012,1.0,0.0,0.5150667695546305,0.294899779231922,0.8407008647918701,0.18823529411764706,0.25821365657518197,40.364875725184525,0.14942528735632185,0.8560710457816567,0.0,0.6538585248042126,0.3275395300932444,0.8752247095108032,0.38509316770186336,0.2971135812116327,38.869586839891085,0.20612244897959184,1.0,0.0,0.6719524590186325,0.3713455969493832,0.8022740483283997,0.17610062893081763,0.11628797828561423,25.444634884124234,0.048327137546468404,1.0,0.0,0.5350011179605162,0.30005408897887165
diagnostic radiology,abdominal radiology,Malpractice in invasive cardiology: is angiography of abdominal aorta or subclavian artery appropriate in patients undergoing coronary angiography? A meta analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Identification of peripheral vascular disease by angiography in patients undergoing coronary angiography may be considered as malpractice but sometimes seems to be justified under clear entry criteria. The present mata-analysis is aimed to analyze the appropriateness and results of screening angiography of subclavian or abdominal aorta performed at the time of coronary angiography.

METHODS:
A search of published literature for peripheral angiography in patients undergoing coronary angiography over the last 10 years was performed using the MEDLINE database. No language restriction was employed. Only studies enrolling more than 100 patients for abdominal aortography and 50 patients for subclavian/internal mammary artery angiography were considered. Reference lists from identified studies were also reviewed to identify other potentially relevant references.

RESULTS:
Twenty-nine studies were retrieved: 8 articles about subclavian artery (SA) and internal mammary (IMA) angiography and 21 about renal (RA) and aortoiliac (AOI) angiography. The total number of patients enrolled was 27,936. Nine studies out of 29 were prospective. Defined entry criteria were reported in 24 out of 29 studies. Significant SA and IMA stenosis were reported in 5.5 and 9% of patients, respectively. RA stenosis >50% was present in 12.7% of patients with CAD. Finally, undetected AOI disease was reported in 35.5% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Mean complication rate was 0.8 +/- 0.6%. Predictors of SA and IMA stenosis were unclear. Age, multi-risk profile, multi-vessel CAD, history of PVD or carotid disease, severe hypertension, unexplained renal dysfunction or decreased creatinine clearance have been reported most frequently as predictors of RA and AOI disease in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

CONCLUSIONS:
Consistent evidence of appropriateness of renal angiography in selected patients undergoing coronary angiography have been produced in literature. IMA and AOI angiography seem to be not justified unless they are part of SA in patients scheduled for arterial conduit with brachial differential pressure, thoracic irradiation or surgery, or of abdominal angiography to detect RA stenosis in laboratories with radiological digital peripheral equipment.",Identification of peripheral vascular disease by angiography in patients undergoing coronary angiography may be considered as malpractice but sometimes seems to be justified under clear entry criteria.

Case studies have reported subclavian artery stenosis leading to recurrent angina in patients post-coronary bypass surgery, which was relieved by angioplasty and stenting of the subclavian artery [2, 4]. Moreover, simultaneous interventions in carotid and other extracarotid arteries, including the abdominal aorta and subclavian artery, were found to be feasible and relatively safe [7]. A prospective study found significant coronary artery disease in patients with abdominal aortic or carotid disease and vice versa, suggesting the benefit of aggressive screening [9]. However, coronary angiography was identified as a common precipitating factor for atheroembolic renal disease requiring dialysis [10]. 

TL;DR: Given the association between coronary artery disease and plaques in the abdominal aorta and subclavian artery, angiography of these arteries may be appropriate in patients undergoing coronary angiography, although potential risks such as atheroembolic renal disease should be considered [1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10].

","Angiography is an appropriate imaging method for diagnosing pathologic conditions of the abdominal aorta and subclavian artery, particularly when there is a suspicion of subclavian stenosis or when a patient is undergoing coronary artery revascularization using the intermammary artery. CT angiography is the preferred method for diagnosis of subclavian artery injuries, as it has nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity when placed in an experienced endovascular surgeon's hands. Angiography is also recommended for preoperative planning in patients undergoing coronary angiography, as it provides the best diagnostic information. Risk factor control and best medical therapy are recommended in all patients with symptomatic upper extremity artery disease, and revascularization is indicated in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients under certain circumstances.",0.793994128704071,0.14814814814814814,0.16843395557655955,38.62556421219736,0.08389261744966443,0.939123979213066,0.0,0.5441464958011463,0.2797008751592948,0.7984530329704285,0.15384615384615383,0.22191108834042955,42.38556424886873,0.09689922480620156,0.8552338530066815,0.0,0.5636540098985037,0.284196204051849,0.7760236263275146,0.13278008298755187,0.09974924882336042,21.00934614211218,0.04800936768149883,1.0,0.0,0.5214284360408783,0.2849661861308001,0.7848285436630249,0.1443298969072165,0.10544217687074829,23.055961700326623,0.05177993527508091,1.0,0.0,0.5363550142330282,0.2871372049221766,0.8006874322891235,0.14953271028037382,0.18570784093659906,41.89523628073356,0.08527131782945736,0.8054936896807722,0.0,0.5642215767593095,0.28392674440641225,0.7545957565307617,0.12418300653594772,0.07175043929130705,17.310753406147132,0.035897435897435895,1.0,0.0,0.49670803766894805,0.2757073165790765,0.7527823448181152,0.13740458015267173,0.07323568575233022,19.47917681447226,0.040372670807453416,1.0,0.0,0.490535207092762,0.27381634462785404,0.8329876661300659,0.21153846153846154,0.23366564417177915,42.43690308705798,0.10077519379844961,0.7831207396908956,0.0,0.6420026632218525,0.31195986575900814,0.7665862441062927,0.10932475884244372,0.07723998707503692,16.033345825834875,0.03577661431064572,1.0,0.0,0.508710729358531,0.2788916792534008,0.7710704207420349,0.13229571984435795,0.08165225744476465,18.695395404089847,0.0447427293064877,1.0,0.0,0.5165867715105683,0.28117758748156085,0.815535306930542,0.17543859649122806,0.20825546465107908,41.7029381378137,0.09689922480620156,0.8198713189804503,0.0,0.5879493547019674,0.29599245728177526,0.8195459842681885,0.25233644859813087,0.18491302598696654,26.596355914401865,0.1162079510703364,1.0,0.0,0.5942703958352407,0.31797861080235235,0.7902231812477112,0.15642458100558662,0.12872555272108843,27.806830107363062,0.06275303643724696,1.0,0.0,0.5544856973858767,0.2887805068329081
emergency medicine,adult orthopedics,How Satisfied Are Patients and Surgeons with Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a rapid pivot toward telemedicine owing to closure of in-person elective clinics and sustained efforts at physical distancing worldwide. Throughout this period, there has been revived enthusiasm for delivering and receiving orthopaedic care remotely. Unfortunately, rapidly published editorials and commentaries during the pandemic have not adequately conveyed findings of published randomized trials on this topic.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What are the levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction with the use of telemedicine as a tool for orthopaedic care delivery? (2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits?

METHODS:
In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine, and secondary objectives to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes and time commitment. We used combinations of search keywords and medical subject headings around the terms ""telemedicine"", ""telehealth"", and ""virtual care"" combined with ""orthopaedic"", ""orthopaedic surgery"" and ""randomized."" We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments. Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study. Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded. Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors). We screened 133 published articles; 12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups). Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials).

RESULTS:
There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.40 to 1.99]; p = 0.79). There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.07 to 2.19]; p = 0.28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function. Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32]; p = 0.03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281]; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:
Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments. Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses. Future studies must be adequately powered to detect these differences to ensure patient safety is not compromised with the use of telemedicine. Although telemedicine may lead to a similar patient experience, surgeons should maintain a low threshold for follow-up with in-person assessments whenever possible in the absence of further safety data.

"," The use of telemedicine in orthopaedic care during the COVID-19 pandemic has been generally well-received by patients and surgeons, though satisfaction levels vary. Patients have reported high satisfaction rates, with many appreciating the convenience and time-saving aspects of telemedicine [3][7][8][11][12][14][15]. Surgeons have also reported satisfaction with telemedicine, though some expressed concerns about the inability to perform physical examinations, medicolegal issues, and reimbursement parity [2][6][7][10][13][15]. Despite these concerns, many surgeons plan to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic [10][13]. Certain populations, like patients seeking fracture care and those living far from the clinic, reported higher satisfaction with telemedicine [4]. However, some studies found that overall patient satisfaction with telemedicine was lower than with in-person visits [4][10]. As with any new technology, there are barriers to adoption, including lack of awareness, implementation costs, and concerns about medicolegal liability [2]. Further high-quality research is needed to fully understand the long-term outcomes of telemedicine in orthopaedics [3].

TL;DR: Patients and surgeons are generally satisfied with telemedicine in orthopaedic care during the COVID-19 pandemic, but satisfaction levels vary and there are some concerns, particularly from surgeons, about its limitations.

These studies have shown varying levels of satisfaction among both patients and surgeons.

One study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2020 found that patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine for orthopaedic care during the pandemic. The study reported that 86% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with their telemedicine experience. Patients appreciated the convenience, reduced travel time, and decreased risk of exposure to COVID-19 associated with telemedicine appointments.

Another study published in the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare in 2021 assessed surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine in orthopaedic care. The study found that surgeons had mixed opinions about telemedicine. Some surgeons reported high satisfaction, citing benefits such as increased efficiency, improved patient access, and reduced no-show rates. However, other surgeons expressed concerns about the limitations of telemedicine, such as the inability to perform physical examinations and the challenges of assessing certain orthopaedic conditions remotely.

Overall, while patient satisfaction with telemedicine in orthopaedic care during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be relatively high, surgeon satisfaction is more varied. Telemedicine has shown potential benefits in terms of convenience and reduced exposure to COVID-19, but it also has limitations that may affect surgeon satisfaction. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term impact and effectiveness of telemedicine in orthopaedic care.","The papers suggest that telemedicine has been widely adopted in orthopaedic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and has generally been well-received by both patients and surgeons. Hurley 2020 found that 84.8% of surgeons were using telemedicine during the pandemic, with 70.3% of them reporting overall satisfaction with its use. Rizzi 2020 found that 95% of patients rated their telemedicine encounters with orthopaedic surgeons as ""good"" or ""very good,"" and 93% reported they would participate in a telemedicine encounter again. Haider 2020's systematic review found that telemedicine in orthopaedics can be safe, cost-effective, and valid in clinical assessment, with high patient and clinician satisfaction. Satin 2020 found that 87.7% of spine patients were satisfied with their telemedicine visits during the pandemic, and 45% indicated a preference for telemedicine over in-person visits in the future.

","Telemedicine has become an increasingly popular form of providing health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides benefits to both patients and physicians, such as less time away from family and work, potential cost savings on travel expenses, and improved private payer reimbursement for providers. Video conferencing during the postoperative period (“telerounds”) has been shown to improve patient satisfaction and reduce hospitalization time. There should, however, be clear communication between hospital administration, providers, and clinic staff regarding expectations for screening, PPE, and the use of new technologies for telemedicine consultations. All of these efforts have shown to improve patient satisfaction and should be continued as the use of telemedicine becomes more commonplace.",0.7741721272468567,0.1514476614699332,0.19396519189206607,34.65800793847847,0.09135559921414538,1.0,0.0,0.6416597466263644,0.2941226270547274,0.7621526718139648,0.12203389830508474,0.23443689955233638,39.44387405903995,0.04946236559139785,0.8046579908569114,0.0,0.6114291075397941,0.2709050279528659,0.7847745418548584,0.13012048192771083,0.16418480336006108,36.34576894070059,0.0730550284629981,1.0,0.0,0.6120523870521908,0.29493427607348155,0.7847875952720642,0.13089005235602094,0.17786561264822134,39.047624451242996,0.08064516129032258,0.8243705287488775,0.0,0.6230376389893618,0.2966113945632781,0.7361947894096375,0.05809128630705394,0.1851851851851852,26.789332778357466,0.017204301075268817,0.8744630479347162,0.0,0.5981994161139363,0.2475890764892732,0.7761995196342468,0.13440860215053763,0.20397208803005903,40.81261374930877,0.0913978494623656,0.8385966018710318,0.0,0.6164203575573677,0.29271678480341,0.7775145173072815,0.12173913043478263,0.23345310875066877,41.687674599990636,0.08064516129032258,0.7633641413203572,0.0,0.6223076536799922,0.2933681194446498,0.7377419471740723,0.07659574468085106,0.17819706498951784,23.004886517310606,0.026881720430107527,0.9152188925405633,0.0,0.6368871950186216,0.2515835552134465,0.7898923754692078,0.14285714285714288,0.21661440051171538,41.110344059091005,0.09462365591397849,0.927202646924099,0.0,0.6198031617389931,0.298403413136396,0.7884888052940369,0.14634146341463414,0.24183058762946097,43.641080139657134,0.08494623655913978,0.8696993060909792,0.0,0.6312542143256166,0.298529556724709,0.7560074329376221,0.07346938775510203,0.18229166666666669,26.793877607337137,0.023655913978494623,0.8886784231202524,0.0,0.6111736921769269,0.2614400314417383,0.7703670859336853,0.13123359580052496,0.20440251572327042,38.575397667671254,0.07419354838709677,0.8527056157852501,0.0,0.6189753415519625,0.28860759537241787,0.741736888885498,0.09907120743034055,0.2063596336323609,38.238602079187864,0.06774193548387097,0.7424000440577155,0.0,0.5683019879875304,0.2612758747435368
emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders,' (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment.

METHODS:
Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment.

RESULTS:
A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9-62.7) where <500Â ml was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9-61.0) where 500Â ml was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9-79.2) where >500Â ml was administered (pâ=â0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for <15Â minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2-64.1) and for 15-30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4-62.4, pâ=â1). Where the infusion time was â¥30Â minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6-54, pâ=â0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10Â minutes, and >10Â minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (pâ=â0.47).

CONCLUSIONS:
The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.","The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness.

A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.," The fluid challenge technique is a common method used in fluid management of critically ill patients to assess whether a patient has a preload reserve that can be used to increase stroke volume with further fluids [2]. Recent advances have seen the development of a ""mini"" fluid challenge of 100 ml to overcome the risk of fluid overload associated with the classical fluid challenge [1]. The passive leg raising test has also been identified as a reliable method for assessing fluid responsiveness [1]. A study found that the transient increase in tidal volume from 6 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight (tidal volume challenge), can predict fluid responsiveness with high accuracy [3]. Dynamic changes in arterial waveform-derived variables during mechanical ventilation are highly accurate in predicting volume responsiveness in critically ill patients [8]. However, the use of central venous pressure (CVP) to predict fluid responsiveness has been questioned due to a very poor relationship between CVP and measured blood volume [9]. Similarly, ultrasound evaluation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its respiratory variations has been found to be unreliable in predicting fluid responsiveness [7].

TL;DR: The fluid challenge technique, particularly when involving a transient increase in tidal volume, has been shown to be effective in predicting fluid responsiveness, although the use of central venous pressure and ultrasound evaluations of the inferior vena cava are less reliable methods.

The reliability of this technique in predicting fluid responsiveness, however, has been questioned. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ultrasound evaluation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and its respiratory variations, which are commonly used in fluid challenge techniques, are not reliable in predicting fluid responsiveness [3]. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial found that dynamic measures, such as stroke volume change during passive leg raise, could guide fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock, resulting in lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure [4]. Another study found that changes in pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation after increasing tidal volume could predict fluid responsiveness with high accuracy [8]. A meta-analysis of 13 trials with a total of 1,652 patients showed that dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness was associated with a reduced risk of mortality and a decrease in ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation [11]. However, most of the included trials were at high risk of bias [11].

TL;DR: The fluid challenge technique is commonly used in fluid management, but its reliability in predicting fluid responsiveness is questionable. Dynamic measures may provide a more accurate prediction of fluid responsiveness and improve patient outcomes, but the evidence is mixed and many studies have a high risk of bias. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness, such as pulse pressure variation, are favored over static measurements like central venous pressure, which has been found to be a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness [12,13,18]. However, the reliability of dynamic measurements can be limited in certain conditions, leading to the development of maneuvers like passive leg raising and mini-fluid boluses to assess fluid responsiveness [3,16,20]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 studies showed that dynamic changes in pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and systolic pressure variation were highly accurate in predicting volume responsiveness [12]. Another review of 11 studies found that the fluid challenge technique increased cardiac output in responders, and that the calculation of mean systemic filling pressure analogue could help identify patients likely to respond to a fluid volume challenge [7]. A randomized controlled trial found that using dynamic assessments to guide fluid administration may improve outcomes in patients with septic shock [4]. However, a post hoc analysis of the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial found no difference in clinically relevant outcomes between fluid responders and non-fluid responders [14].

The impact of this technique on the diagnosis of fluid responsiveness is significant. 

By administering a defined volume of fluid over a short period of time and monitoring the patient's hemodynamic response, clinicians can determine whether a patient is fluid responsive or not. If the patient's cardiac output significantly increases in response to the fluid challenge, they are considered fluid responsive. This can guide further fluid management, helping to avoid both fluid overload and under-resuscitation.

However, it's important to note that the fluid challenge technique is not without limitations. It may not be suitable for all patients, particularly those with certain cardiovascular or renal conditions. Additionally, the technique requires careful monitoring and interpretation of hemodynamic parameters, which may not be feasible in all clinical settings.","The fluid challenge technique is a diagnostic tool used to assess fluid responsiveness in patients. It involves administering a bolus of intravenous fluid and monitoring the patient's hemodynamic response. The impact of the fluid challenge technique on the diagnosis of fluid responsiveness is that it helps determine whether a patient will benefit from additional fluid administration. If the patient's hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure and cardiac output, improve after the fluid challenge, it suggests that the patient is fluid responsive and may benefit from further fluid administration. Conversely, if there is no significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters, it indicates that the patient is not fluid responsive and additional fluid administration may not be beneficial. The fluid challenge technique is commonly used in critically ill patients to guide fluid management and optimize hemodynamic status.","The fluid challenge technique is commonly used to diagnose fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Toscani 2017 found that the proportion of responders did not differ significantly based on the volume or type of fluid administered, but decreased with longer infusion times. Bednarczyk 2017 found that goal-directed therapy guided by assessment of fluid responsiveness was associated with reduced mortality, ICU length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Backer 2005 found that pulse pressure variation is a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients only when tidal volume is at least 8 ml/kg. Messina 2018 found that the key components of fluid challenge, including type of fluid, volume, and time of infusion, are quite standardized in the operating room, but pooled sensitivity and specificity of both pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation are limited."," The fluid challenge technique is a common method used in fluid management of critically ill patients to assess whether a patient has a preload reserve that can be used to increase stroke volume with further fluids [2]. Recent advances have seen the development of a ""mini"" fluid challenge of 100 ml to overcome the risk of fluid overload associated with the classical fluid challenge [1]. The passive leg raising test has also been identified as a reliable method for assessing fluid responsiveness [1]. A study found that the transient increase in tidal volume from 6 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight (tidal volume challenge), can predict fluid responsiveness with high accuracy [3]. Dynamic changes in arterial waveform-derived variables during mechanical ventilation are highly accurate in predicting volume responsiveness in critically ill patients [8]. However, the use of central venous pressure (CVP) to predict fluid responsiveness has been questioned due to a very poor relationship between CVP and measured blood volume [9]. Similarly, ultrasound evaluation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its respiratory variations has been found to be unreliable in predicting fluid responsiveness [7].

"," The fluid challenge technique, particularly when involving a transient increase in tidal volume, has been shown to be effective in predicting fluid responsiveness, although the use of central venous pressure and ultrasound evaluations of the inferior vena cava are less reliable methods.

"," The fluid challenge technique is widely used in managing fluid in critically ill patients, and it involves administering small amounts of fluid in a short time to assess if the patient has a preload reserve that could be used to increase stroke volume with further fluids [1]. The reliability of this technique in predicting fluid responsiveness, however, has been questioned. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ultrasound evaluation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and its respiratory variations, which are commonly used in fluid challenge techniques, are not reliable in predicting fluid responsiveness [3]. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial found that dynamic measures, such as stroke volume change during passive leg raise, could guide fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock, resulting in lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure [4]. Another study found that changes in pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation after increasing tidal volume could predict fluid responsiveness with high accuracy [8]. A meta-analysis of 13 trials with a total of 1,652 patients showed that dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness was associated with a reduced risk of mortality and a decrease in ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation [11]. However, most of the included trials were at high risk of bias [11].

"," The fluid challenge technique is commonly used in fluid management, but its reliability in predicting fluid responsiveness is questionable. Dynamic measures may provide a more accurate prediction of fluid responsiveness and improve patient outcomes, but the evidence is mixed and many studies have a high risk of bias. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The fluid challenge technique is commonly used to assess fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis or septic shock [1,2,6,16,20]. Dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness, such as pulse pressure variation, are favored over static measurements like central venous pressure, which has been found to be a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness [12,13,18]. However, the reliability of dynamic measurements can be limited in certain conditions, leading to the development of maneuvers like passive leg raising and mini-fluid boluses to assess fluid responsiveness [3,16,20]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 studies showed that dynamic changes in pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and systolic pressure variation were highly accurate in predicting volume responsiveness [12]. Another review of 11 studies found that the fluid challenge technique increased cardiac output in responders, and that the calculation of mean systemic filling pressure analogue could help identify patients likely to respond to a fluid volume challenge [7]. A randomized controlled trial found that using dynamic assessments to guide fluid administration may improve outcomes in patients with septic shock [4]. However, a post hoc analysis of the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial found no difference in clinically relevant outcomes between fluid responders and non-fluid responders [14]. 

"," The fluid challenge technique, often combined with dynamic measurements like pulse pressure variation, can effectively assess fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients, potentially improving outcomes in conditions like septic shock. However, the impact on clinically relevant outcomes may vary, and further research is needed to optimize its use.

","In a recent study, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) were trained to do a Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam to diagnose abdominal fluid in the emergency department. Results showed a sensitivity of 61.3%, a specificity of 96.3%, positive predictive value of 89.1%, and a negative predictive value of 83.2%. However, when analyzing the presence of a moderate or significant amount of fluid, the sensitivity improved to 86.2%. This suggests a benefit of the fluid challenge technique in diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. Additionally, a study on 249 hospitalized patients found a higher incidence of fluid overload in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation, without improvement in clinical outcomes. Therefore, dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness with pulse pressure or stroke volume variability is recommended.",0.7467660307884216,0.09210526315789475,0.03355704697986577,6.135355140695144,0.0156794425087108,1.0,0.0,0.44655663058871314,0.24947672286397812,0.7549677491188049,0.07734806629834255,0.04504561796228462,5.570920231354773,0.017191977077363897,1.0,0.0,0.4561347189036446,0.2608455107684849,0.7223206162452698,0.056680161943319846,0.02271788517141677,4.283582539192876,0.012149532710280374,1.0,0.0,0.40525891567833233,0.2394727819451954,0.7346179485321045,0.06896551724137931,0.027904616945712838,5.324697674781625,0.014942528735632184,1.0,0.0,0.41896116711357806,0.24560375756796834,0.7940070629119873,0.10344827586206898,0.08101851851851852,17.22270653792025,0.03932584269662921,1.0,0.0,0.513313787240608,0.2758099830555008,0.7325096726417542,0.05423728813559322,0.02109704641350211,3.8613040809177317,0.0112,1.0,0.0,0.40542642714885563,0.2438326287008765,0.7347548007965088,0.05907172995780591,0.032662559637991244,4.802280896994219,0.014141414141414142,1.0,0.0,0.4108261473200939,0.2426036967824868,0.7860836982727051,0.11111111111111112,0.07936507936507936,13.57954390957395,0.037815126050420166,1.0,0.0,0.5139575766192542,0.2747720645920733,0.7038108706474304,0.05755395683453236,0.019025875190258754,3.382550811972988,0.010398613518197574,1.0,0.0,0.3738516549312929,0.22490147760678889,0.7079880833625793,0.06140350877192983,0.023843586075345733,4.183800785179516,0.013071895424836602,1.0,0.0,0.38124350122166023,0.22610712927008805,0.7770792245864868,0.125,0.07797270955165693,13.695822473078687,0.04205607476635514,1.0,0.0,0.48419805566469826,0.26477059762059124,0.7663664221763611,0.07741935483870968,0.047514619883040926,7.737347865016808,0.019933554817275746,1.0,0.0,0.4492770206482931,0.2689622107845212,0.7427492141723633,0.08275862068965517,0.037037037037037035,6.399713648120191,0.015358361774744027,1.0,0.0,0.4309322447978962,0.25580393508497595
emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,Does pre-hospital endotracheal intubation improve survival in adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is currently considered superior to supraglottic airway devices (SGA) for survival and other outcomes among adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We aimed to determine if the research supports this conclusion by conducting a systematic review.

METHODS:
We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL databases for studies published between January 1, 1980, and 30 April 30, 2013, which compared pre-hospital use of ETI with SGA for outcomes of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); survival to hospital admission; survival to hospital discharge; and favorable neurological or functional status. We selected studies using pre-specified criteria. Included studies were independently screened for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We did not pool results because of study variability. Study outcomes were extracted and results presented as summed odds ratios with 95% CI.

RESULTS:
We identified five eligible studies: one quasi-randomized controlled trial and four cohort studies, involving 303,348 patients in total. Only three of the five studies reported a higher proportion of ROSC with ETI versus SGA with no difference reported in the remaining two. None found significant differences between ETI and SGA for survival to hospital admission or discharge. One study reported better functional status at discharge for ETI versus SGA. Two studies reported no significant difference for favorable neurological status between ETI and SGA.

CONCLUSION:

Current evidence does not conclusively support the superiority of ETI over SGA for multiple outcomes among adults with OHCA."," The efficacy of pre-hospital endotracheal intubation (ETI) in improving survival in adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains unclear, as indicated by two studies. A large prospective study in Osaka, Japan found no significant difference in neurologically favorable one-month survival between those receiving ETI and those receiving supraglottic airway devices (SGA). Early placement of any advanced airway was associated with better neurological outcomes, but ETI itself was not a significant predictor of favorable outcome [1]. This finding is supported by a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials, which found no significant difference in survival between ETI and other airway management strategies in adults with non-traumatic OHCA. The review concluded that the efficacy of emergency intubation has not been rigorously studied and emphasized the need for a high-quality RCT comparing ETI with basic bag-valve-mask maneuvers in adult OHCA [2].

","Prehospital endotracheal intubation is a lifesaving procedure used to manage difficult airways and provide ventilation in the absence of other options. While literature is conflicted on the morbidity and mortality benefit of prehospital intubation, studies have shown that adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest who receive resuscitation attempts by emergency medical services have a rate of survival to hospital discharge significantly lower than those who develop cardiac arrest in a hospital. Factors such as witnessed cardiac arrest, defibrillation, and age all increase the likelihood of ROSC.

emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,Is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation more effective and safer than conventional protective ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"INTRODUCTION:
Comprehensively evaluating the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is important to allow clinicians who are using or considering this intervention to make appropriate decisions.

METHODS:
To find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFOV with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) as an initial treatment for adult ARDS patients, we searched electronic databases (including PubMed, MedLine, Springer Link, Elsevier Science Direct, ISI web of knowledge, and EMBASE) with the following terms: ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"", ""acute lung injury"", and ""high frequency oscillation ventilation"". Additional sources included reference lists from the identified primary studies and relevant meta-analyses. Two investigators independently screened articles and extracted data. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models.

RESULTS:
We included 6 RCTs with a total of 1,608 patients in this meta-analysis. Compared with CMV, HFOV did not significantly reduce the mortality at 30 or 28Â days. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.051 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.813 to 1.358). ICU mortality was also not significantly reduced in HFOV group, with a pooled RR of 1.218 (95% CI 0.925 to 1.604). The pooled effect sizes of HFOV for oxygenation failure, ventilation failure and duration of mechanical ventilation were 0.557 (95% CI 0.351 to 0.884), 0.892 (95% CI 0.435 to 1.829) and 0.079 (95% CI -0.045 to 0.203), respectively. The risk of barotrauma and hypotension were similar between the CMV group and HFOV group, with a RR of 1.205 (95% CI 0.834 to 1.742) and a RR of 1.326 (95% CI 0.271 to 6.476), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:
Although HFOV seems not to increase the risk of barotrauma or hypotension, and reduces the risk of oxygenation failure, it does not improve survival in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.",Comprehensively evaluating the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is important to allow clinicians who are using or considering this intervention to make appropriate decisions.,"To find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFOV with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) as an initial treatment for adult ARDS patients, we searched electronic databases (including PubMed, MedLine, Springer Link, Elsevier Science Direct, ISI web of knowledge, and EMBASE) with the following terms: ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"", ""acute lung injury"", and ""high frequency oscillation ventilation"".

It's important for clinicians to consider individual patient characteristics and circumstances when choosing a ventilation strategy.","High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and conventional protective ventilation are both commonly used strategies for managing adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. However, there is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that HFOV is more effective or safer than conventional protective ventilation in these patients.

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to compare the two ventilation strategies, but the results have been inconclusive. Some studies have shown no significant difference in mortality rates between HFOV and conventional protective ventilation, while others have reported conflicting results.

A meta-analysis published in 2013, which included data from 10 RCTs, found no significant difference in mortality rates between HFOV and conventional protective ventilation in adult ARDS patients. However, the analysis did suggest that HFOV may be associated with a higher risk of barotrauma (lung injury caused by excessive pressure) compared to conventional protective ventilation.

It is important to note that the choice between HFOV and conventional protective ventilation should be individualized based on the patient's specific clinical condition and the expertise of the healthcare team. The decision should take into consideration factors such as the severity of ARDS, the patient's underlying comorbidities, and the available resources and expertise for implementing each ventilation strategy.

In conclusion, there is currently no clear evidence to support the superiority of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation over conventional protective ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. The choice of ventilation strategy should be based on individual patient factors and clinical judgment.","The papers suggest that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may be a safe and effective alternative to conventional ventilation for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Derdak 2002 and Derdak 2003 found that HFOV improved oxygenation in ARDS patients, and that it was as safe and effective as conventional ventilation. Downar 2006 also suggests that HFOV may improve outcomes if used early in the course of ARDS or in certain populations. However, Fessler 2007 notes that evidence is lacking that HFOV improves survival in adults with ARDS, and that heavy sedation and often paralysis are necessary. Overall, the papers suggest that HFOV may be a viable option for treating ARDS in adults, but further research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety compared to conventional ventilation."," High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has been evaluated in multiple studies for its efficacy and safety in treating adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

","This research examines whether high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is an effective and safer alternative to conventional protective ventilation for adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Studies have shown that high-frequency settings are safe and effective when treating infants with PIE and resulted in similar oxygenation and lower peak pressures than rapid-rate ventilation. However, the landmark OSCILLATE and OSCAR trials have shown that early HFOV use in moderate to severe ARDS may lead to an increase in mortality. No absolute contraindications have been found for HFOV, however it could lead to air trapping and other complications such as pneumothorax. Novel invasive ventilation strategies such as APRV and recruitment maneuvers can help improve oxygenation but these have not been shown to improve mortality. For mild and some moderate ARDS patients, non-invasive strategies such as CPAP, BiPAP, proportional-assist ventilation and high-flow nasal cannulas may be beneficial though intubation may be necessary if a patient's condition worsens. In conclusion, the use of HFOV in moderate to severe ARDS patients is not recommended due to the potential increased risk of mortality, while non-invasive ventilation can be used in mild ARDS patients.",0.7516557574272156,0.11469534050179211,0.06919206038579816,8.052964666807487,0.03910614525139665,1.0,0.0,0.46381627556424554,0.27428750974612065,0.810066282749176,0.14705882352941174,0.1730520116763503,19.0851965172367,0.09030837004405286,1.0,0.0,0.5521395916956059,0.31177442272814676,0.7689154148101807,0.12546125461254612,0.09605091862955656,10.090216165630844,0.0446927374301676,1.0,0.0,0.4770820830017328,0.2862011373082125,0.7714394927024841,0.09777777777777777,0.08698370664607011,11.426207723301326,0.036281179138321996,1.0,0.0,0.48985029994807344,0.2896285005779775,0.8393623232841492,0.21333333333333335,0.44570440130693834,40.26469069890052,0.23529411764705882,1.0,0.0,0.6003612107955493,0.33284269665745997,0.7696501612663269,0.12837837837837837,0.08660347648893142,9.471205903782456,0.05025996533795494,1.0,0.0,0.48442474368494004,0.2927678869968178,0.7738093733787537,0.09243697478991596,0.09608217069825019,11.08060769388238,0.046067415730337076,1.0,0.0,0.48616939849707463,0.29449973524922085,0.8551554083824158,0.20689655172413793,0.32311730445000764,34.40299237077636,0.2066115702479339,1.0,0.0,0.6221642440015619,0.34282857367272845,0.7841303944587708,0.18181818181818182,0.10868781739181388,13.57855488828793,0.06012024048096192,1.0,0.0,0.4681867344565811,0.29670065762706255,0.7887260913848877,0.14507772020725387,0.11782453815747515,16.106304444654,0.06235011990407674,1.0,0.0,0.4744926305344472,0.30017223238502394,0.8114170432090759,0.29850746268656714,0.40871934604904636,39.27579650612263,0.23943661971830985,0.7810618500273672,0.0,0.609512732852073,0.30384511295300387,0.7813548445701599,0.09999999999999999,0.11760446048338036,15.664690242003315,0.0498220640569395,1.0,0.0,0.5260850551227728,0.2873002784744464,0.7814736366271973,0.08849557522123895,0.10030455508474578,11.409737810451647,0.042997542997543,1.0,0.0,0.5032503051992548,0.29135399591080163
emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Does Physical Exercise Enhance the Immune Response after Vaccination? A Systematic Review for Clinical Indications of COVID-19 Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND:
Stimulating protective immunity with vaccines appears to be the most promising option for providing widespread moderate to high protection against COVID-19 in people over the age of 18. Regular exercise improves the immune response, transmitting possible benefits against virus infections. The aim of this review is to study the effects of physical activity on vaccine injections, helping to develop new recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

METHODS:
A comprehensive review of the existing literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The internal quality of the studies was assessed according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The outcomes analyzed were antibody titer, the level of lymphocytes CD4, CD8, InterLeukin 6 (IL6), leukocytes level, the visual analogue scale (VAS) for overall pain rating, arm and forearm circumferences and volume of oxygen (VO2) peak.

RESULTS:
Fourteen articles were selected for the analysis. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) (<i>n</i> = 8) and controlled trials (CT) (<i>n</i> = 6). According to PEDro, the 'fair' category (<i>n</i> = 7) was the most represented, followed by 'good' (<i>n</i> = 6) and 'excellent' (<i>n</i> = 1). Physical training showed a positive effect on antibody titers of the vaccine; yet, different variables seem to influence antibody titers: higher new vs. old antigen in the vaccine, higher in younger vs. older individuals, and higher in females vs. males. After exercise, when analyzing variables of direct response to the vaccine, such as the amount of CD4, IL-6 and leukocytes, higher levels were observed in the patients who performed physical exercise compared to the control group. In the same way, better results were observed in physiological variables such as VO2 and limb circumferences, or subjective variables such as pain, which showed better results than the control group.

CONCLUSIONS:
The immune response (antibody titers) depends on age, gender and the intensity of physical activity: long-term protocols at moderate intensity are the most recommended. All of these aspects also have to be carefully considered for the COVID-19 vaccination.","Stimulating protective immunity with vaccines appears to be the most promising option for providing widespread moderate to high protection against COVID-19 in people over the age of 18.

All of these aspects also have to be carefully considered for the COVID-19 vaccination."," The relationship between physical exercise and immune response post-vaccination is complex and appears to depend on various factors, including the type, intensity, and timing of exercise, as well as individual characteristics such as age and health status [2,3,4,5,6,8,13,15,16,18,19,20]. A systematic review of 30 intervention studies reported that resistance exercise can activate immune signaling pathways and improve antioxidant enzyme expression, potentially enhancing immune responses [5]. However, the effects of resistance exercise on lymphocyte proliferation remain unclear [5]. Several randomized controlled trials have investigated the impact of exercise on the immune response to vaccination, with mixed results. Some trials found that exercise can enhance antibody responses to certain vaccine strains or in certain populations [10,14], while others found no significant effects of exercise on antibody responses or cell-mediated immunity [11,14,17]. A non-randomized controlled study found that older adults who practiced combined exercise training had higher levels of specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination [20]. However, the study also found that the interleukin 10 (IL-10) to interleukin 6 (IL-6) ratio post-vaccination was higher in the exercise training group, suggesting a possible anti-inflammatory effect of exercise [20]. Another study found that regular physical activity was associated with increased CD4 cell counts and salivary immunoglobulin IgA concentration, as well as decreased neutrophil counts [15]. However, the antibody concentration after vaccination was higher with an adjunct physical activity program [15].

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that physical exercise may have the potential to enhance immune responses post-vaccination, but the effects appear to vary depending on the type, intensity, and timing of exercise, as well as individual characteristics. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal exercise protocols for enhancing vaccine-induced immunity.

","The evidence suggests that moderate-intensity physical exercise can have a slight enhancing effect on the immune response following vaccination. However, extreme physical exertion such as extreme sports or alteration of gravity can reduce the amount of type B lymphocytes and have a negative effect on the immune response. Vaccines make use of active immunity to stimulate the immune system and create immunoglobins against the targeted pathogen; however, multiple doses of a toxoid vaccine are often necessary to achieve high immunogenicity.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Repair of rotator cuff tears in patients aged 75 years and older: Does it make sense? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Rotator cuff injuries are common, and morbidity increases with age. The asymptomatic full-thickness tear rate is 40% in the over 75-year-old population.

PURPOSE:
This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the outcomes of rotator cuff repair among >75 years old patients.

STUDY DESIGN:
Systematic review.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search was performed in the electronic databases of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Studies in English evaluating repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged >75 years were included.

RESULTS:
Six studies were reviewed, including 311 patients (313 shoulders) treated with arthroscopic and/or open rotator cuff repair. Sixty-one patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 252 shoulders with outcome data. Patients in this age group demonstrated a significant improvement in the clinical and functional scores after rotator cuff repair, with a high satisfaction rate. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 43.8 (range, 42.0-45.5) preoperatively to 85.3 (range, 84.0 to 86.5) postoperatively, and the mean Constant scores improved from 45.4 (range, 34.7-55.5) to 78.6 (range, 67.0-91.6). Pain, evaluated in all studies by the visual analog scale for pain, showed a significant improvement at the last follow-up compared with the mean preoperative score. Furthermore, range of motion and return to daily activities and sports gained marked improvements.

CONCLUSION:
Rotator cuff repair in patients aged >75 years could achieve high clinical success rates with good outcomes and pain relief. Although patients in this age group are at a high risk of retear, rotator cuff repair may offer a good option with significant functional and clinical improvement.","Rotator cuff injuries are common, and morbidity increases with age.

","In adults over the age of 75, research has highlighted the prevalence of rotator cuff tears. A study of 411 asymptomatic shoulders demonstrated a 23% overall prevalence of RC tears with 31% in those of age 70 and 51% in those 80 years of age.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Do psychological factors relate to movement-evoked pain in people with musculoskeletal pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the importance of implementing movement-evoked pain in conventional pain assessments, with a significant role for psychological factors being suggested. Whether or not to include these factors in the assessment of movement-evoked pain has not yet been determined.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim of this systematic review is to explore the association between psychological factors and movement-evoked pain scores in people with musculoskeletal pain.

METHODS:
For this systematic review with meta-analysis, four electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, WOS, and Scopus) were searched. Cross-sectional studies, longitudinal cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials investigating the association between movement-evoked pain and psychological factors in adults with musculoskeletal pain were considered. Meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes with homogeneous data from at least 2 studies. Fischer-Z transformations were used as the measure of effect. Quality of evidence was assessed using the National Institutes of Health's Quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

RESULTS:
Meta-analyses and grading the quality of evidence revealed moderate evidence for a relation between movement-evoked pain and depressive symptoms (Fisher-z=0.27; 95%CI: 0.17, 0.36; 5 studies (n=440)), pain-related fear (Fisher-z=0.35; 95%CI: 0.26, 0.44; 6 studies (n=492)), and pain catastrophizing (Fisher-z=0.47; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.58; 4 studies (n=312)) in people with musculoskeletal pain.

","Psychological factors play an important role in perception of musculoskeletal pain, particularly in cases of chronic pain.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,How do predisposing factors differ between delirium motor subtypes? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospitalised older adults with vast negative consequences. The predominant method of subtyping delirium is by motor activity profile into hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed groups.

OBJECTIVE:
This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated how predisposing factors differ between delirium motor subtypes.

METHODS:
Databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) were systematically searched for studies reporting predisposing factors (prior to delirium) for delirium motor subtypes. A total of 61 studies met inclusion criteria (Nâ=â14,407, mean age 73.63Â years). Random-effects meta-analyses synthesised differences between delirium motor subtypes relative to 22 factors.

RESULTS:
Hypoactive cases were older, had poorer cognition and higher physical risk scores than hyperactive cases and were more likely to be women, living in care homes, taking more medications, with worse functional performance and history of cerebrovascular disease than all remaining subtypes. Hyperactive cases were younger than hypoactive and mixed subtypes and were more likely to be men, with better cognition and lower physical risk scores than all other subtypes. Those with no motor subtype (unable to be classified) were more likely to be women and have better functional performance. Effect sizes were small.

CONCLUSIONS:
Important differences in those who develop motor subtypes of delirium were shown prior to delirium occurrence. We provide robust quantitative evidence for a common clinical assumption that indices of frailty (institutional living, cognitive and functional impairment) are seen more in hypoactive patients. Motor subtypes should be measured across delirium research.

Important differences in those who develop motor subtypes of delirium were shown prior to delirium occurrence. Results provide robust quantitative evidence for a common clinical assumption that indices of frailty (institutional living, cognitive and functional impairment) are seen more in hypoactive patients. Motor subtypes should be measured across delirium research. Motor subtyping has great potential to improve the clinical risk assessment and management of delirium."," Delirium, a significant concern in various settings, can be categorized into different motor subtypes, each associated with distinct predisposing factors. Studies have found that hyperactive delirium is linked with less severe stroke and higher scores of pre-existing irritability/lability [1], while hypoactive delirium, which is often the most common subtype, is associated with factors such as the presence of venous catheters, urinary catheters, and the use of antipsychotics [7]. Mixed delirium is associated with the presence of intravenous lines [9] and the use of antipsychotics or antibiotics [7]. In the ICU setting, predisposing factors for delirium include tobacco use, chronic liver disease, and past episodes of delirium [3]. In the context of COVID-19, advanced age, male gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dementia, and hypoxia are identified as predisposing factors that increase the frequency of delirium [8]. Further, dementia is a common predisposing factor across all delirium subtypes [9]. 

TL;DR: Predisposing factors for delirium motor subtypes vary, with hyperactive delirium associated with less severe stroke and irritability, hypoactive delirium linked with the presence of catheters and use of antipsychotics, and mixed delirium associated with intravenous lines, antipsychotics, and antibiotics. Dementia is a common predisposing factor across all subtypes.

Delirium, a common and serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome, is characterized by disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognition. It is typically classified into three motor subtypes: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed.

1. Hyperactive delirium: This subtype is often associated with withdrawal from alcohol or sedative-hypnotic drugs. Predisposing factors may include a history of substance abuse, particularly alcohol and sedatives. Other factors can include severe illness, metabolic imbalances, and certain medications.

2. Hypoactive delirium: This subtype is often associated with severe illnesses, such as pneumonia or sepsis, and conditions that affect the brain, such as stroke or dementia. Predisposing factors can include older age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, severe illness, and certain medications.

3. Mixed delirium: This subtype is characterized by fluctuating levels of activity, with periods of both hyperactivity and hypoactivity. Predisposing factors can include a combination of those associated with both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium, such as severe illness, certain medications, substance abuse, and conditions that affect the brain.

It's important to note that these are general associations and individual patient factors can greatly influence the presentation of delirium.","Predisposing factors for delirium motor subtypes can differ based on the specific subtype. In general, however, some common predisposing factors for delirium motor subtypes include advanced age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, underlying medical conditions (such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, or stroke), use of certain medications (such as sedatives or anticholinergic drugs), sensory impairment (such as visual or hearing loss), and a history of alcohol or substance abuse. It is important to note that the specific predisposing factors may vary depending on whether the delirium motor subtype is hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed.","These papers collectively suggest that there are differences in predisposing factors between delirium motor subtypes. Ghezzi 2022 found that hypoactive delirium cases were older, had poorer cognition, and higher physical risk scores than hyperactive cases, and were more likely to be women, living in care homes, taking more medications, with worse functional performance and history of cerebrovascular disease than all remaining subtypes. Hyperactive cases were younger than hypoactive and mixed subtypes and were more likely to be men, with better cognition and lower physical risk scores than all other subtypes. Meagher 2011 found that motor profile in delirium is relatively consistent over episode course and relates more closely to delirium phenomenology than to etiology or medication exposure. Morandi 2017 found that hypoactive delirium is the most common subtype among hospitalized older patients, and specific clinical features were associated with different delirium subtypes. Glynn 2021 found that hypoactive delirium was associated with dementia, cerebrovascular and systemic infection aetiologies, while hyperactive delirium was associated with younger age, drug withdrawal, and other systemic aetiologies."," Delirium, a significant concern in various settings, can be categorized into different motor subtypes, each associated with distinct predisposing factors.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,What psychological interventions are effective for the management of persistent physical symptoms (PPS)? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:
Presentation of persistent physical symptoms is associated with increased health care utilization, yet clinical outcomes often remain suboptimal. This systematic review aimed to determine whether psychological interventions are effective for the management of PPS and if so, what are the features of the interventions and at what level of care are they delivered. The review also set out to establish which symptoms in those diagnosed with PPS can be effectively managed with psychological intervention.

METHODS:
Studies were included if they clearly reported a psychological intervention, specified the study sample as adults with a diagnosis of persistent physical symptoms, included a comparator and as a minimum an outcome measure of somatic symptoms. Risk of bias was assessed using the EPHPP. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effect of interventions on somatic symptoms (the primary outcome), anxiety and depression (secondary outcomes).

RESULTS:
Seventeen papers of varying quality indicated that psychological interventions can be effective for the management of somatic symptoms reported by individuals with PPS within a primary care setting. Psychological interventions were also found to be effective at reducing depression symptoms in individuals with PPS in twelve of the included studies. However, the meta-analysis results suggest that the psychological interventions utilized within eleven of the included studies did not significantly impact anxiety symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS:
Psychological interventions have some success in managing somatic symptoms in PPS patients within primary care settings although their effects on other psychological symptoms is more mixed. The review highlights the importance of establishing a clearer diagnostic classification to inform treatment trajectories and the need for appropriate training and support within a multi-disciplinary team to enable the provision of such therapies.","Presentation of persistent physical symptoms is associated with increased health care utilization, yet clinical outcomes often remain suboptimal.

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This is a type of psychotherapy that helps patients understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful behaviors or feelings of distress. It has been found effective in managing PPS, particularly in conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.

2. Mindfulness-Based Therapies: These therapies, which include mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), teach patients to focus their attention on the present moment, which can help reduce stress and improve coping with physical symptoms.

3. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): ACT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies to help individuals live and behave in ways consistent with personal values while developing psychological flexibility.

4. Graded Exercise Therapy (GET): This is a structured treatment approach that involves gradually increasing the amount of physical activity or exercise a patient does. It's often used for conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome.

5. Pacing: This is a strategy where patients learn to balance rest and activity to avoid exacerbating their symptoms. It's often used in conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

6. Biofeedback: This involves using electronic devices to help patients learn to control bodily processes that are normally involuntary, such as heart rate or blood pressure. It can be useful for conditions like chronic pain.

7. Relaxation Techniques: These can include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. These techniques can help reduce stress and improve coping with physical symptoms.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does kyphoplasty affect the global sagittal alignment in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are common in elderly patients and may cause local kyphosis due to the vertebral collapse and wedging. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) with polymethyl methacrylate is widely used to relieve back pain and restore the height and kyphosis of the destroyed vertebra Johnell (Osteoporos Int 17(12):1726-33, 2006); Wasnich (Bone 18: 179S-183S, 1996); Finnern (Osteoporos Int 14:429-436, 2003). However, the influence of BKP on global sagittal alignment (GSA) in patients with OVCF remains unclear.

OBJECTIVE:
To systematically evaluate the relevant literature regarding the influence of BKP on the global spinal sagittal alignment using the following radiological parameters: Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA) and Spinosacral Angle (SSA). Visual Analogue Score (VAS) was also recorded.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the English language literature dating up until August 2022, was undertaken utilising the PRISMA guidelines.

RESULTS:
Of a total of 548 articles, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria (4 level III evidence) and were analyzed. Overall, 201 patients of mean age 73.8Â years (69-77) had acute OVCF of one or more vertebra. The male to female ratio was 51:128. The number of fractured vertebrae was 235 (average of 1.17 fractured vertebrae per patient). Their pre-operative radiological parameters on standing x-rays showed a mean PI of 56Â°, PT 24.1Â°, LL 44.4Â°, TK 42.3Â°, PI-LL 11.7Â°, SVA 4.9Â cm, LL/TK 1 and SSA 114.8Â°. The average VAS was 7.6 (2.6-10). All the patients underwent BKP and their radiological parameters on standing x-rays post operatively showed a mean PI of 55.3Â°, PT 23.1Â°, LL 45.1Â°, TK 41.4Â°, PI-LL 10.3Â°, SVA 4.29Â cm, LL/TK 1.07 and SSA 116.8Â°. Their average VAS post BPK was 2.36 (0-4.8).A statistical analysis comparing the pre/post-operative GSA (111 patients, 3 studies with standard deviations) showed no statistical difference in PT (24.1Â° vs. 23.5Â°, Pâ=â0.93), TK (42.3Â° vs. 42.4Â°, Pâ=â0.57), PI-LL (14.4Â° vs.12.4Â°, Pâ=â0.4), SVA (6.1Â cm vs. 5.5Â cm, Pâ=â0.19) SSA (114.8Â° vs. 116.7Â° Pâ=â0.36). VAS was significantly reduced post BKP (7.1 vs. 2.5 Pâ=â0.004).

CONCLUSION:
Performing BKP procedures does not significantly affect the global sagittal alignment in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. There was however, a significant improvement in pain scores in patients undergoing BKP at 1 or more levels.","To systematically evaluate the relevant literature regarding the influence of BKP on the global spinal sagittal alignment using the following radiological parameters: Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA) and Spinosacral Angle (SSA).

Their pre-operative radiological parameters on standing x-rays showed a mean PI of 56Â°, PT 24.1Â°, LL 44.4Â°, TK 42.3Â°, PI-LL 11.7Â°, SVA 4.9Â cm, LL/TK 1 and SSA 114.8Â°. The average VAS was 7.6 (2.6-10).

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Are local analgesics effective in reducing autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury? A systematic review.,"STUDY DESIGN:
Systematic review.

OBJECTIVES:
To systematically review the evidence on the use of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine or bupivacaine, to prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during iatrogenic procedures or bowel and bladder care routines in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).

METHODS:
A keyword search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Cochrane Reviews, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases identified all English-language studies evaluating the efficacy of local analgesics in reducing AD. Included studies were either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Participants were adults with chronic SCI who received local analgesics prior to AD-triggering procedures or routines. Additionally, studies were required to report blood pressure values as an outcome. The methodology of this review followed the PRISMA checklist and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021219506).

RESULTS:
Four RCTs and two quasi-experimental studies met inclusion criteria. Results were narratively synthesized as meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity across studies included in the review. All six studies administered lidocaine. Lidocaine was found to have a beneficial effect on AD in three studies, no effect in two studies and a detrimental effect in one study.

CONCLUSIONS:
Presently, RCTs and quasi-experimental studies on the use of lidocaine for reducing AD in individuals with SCI had small sample sizes and opposing findings. There is a strong need for definitive, well-monitored clinical trials with adequate sample sizes. Presently there is not enough compelling evidence to support or refute recommendations for the use of lidocaine from the AD management clinical practice guidelines.","To systematically review the evidence on the use of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine or bupivacaine, to prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during iatrogenic procedures or bowel and bladder care routines in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).","A keyword search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Cochrane Reviews, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases identified all English-language studies evaluating the efficacy of local analgesics in reducing AD.

Presently there is not enough compelling evidence to support or refute recommendations for the use of lidocaine from the AD management clinical practice guidelines."," Several studies have investigated the role of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine, in reducing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in individuals with spinal cord injury. A pre-clinical study on rodents found that rectal application of lidocaine significantly reduced AD severity [1]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 26 patients with spinal cord injury demonstrated that lidocaine anal sphincter block reduced anorectal procedure-associated AD [2]. Another double-blind study on 25 patients with cervical spinal cord injury found that topical anorectal anesthesia with lidocaine minimized AD during bowel manipulation [4]. An observational cohort study reported a sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure in 45% of individuals with spinal cord injury after lidocaine instillation [6]. However, a clinical trial involving 13 participants with high-level spinal cord injury found that lidocaine lubricant increased the duration of bowel care and led to higher systolic arterial pressure, suggesting a higher burden of AD [5]. 

TL;DR: Evidence suggests that local analgesics, specifically lidocaine, can reduce autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury, although results may vary based on the method of application and individual patient factors [1,2,4,6]. However, one study indicates that lidocaine lubricant may increase the burden of AD during bowel care [5].

In a study involving eight men with SCI, local anesthesia of the dorsal penile nerves inhibited ejaculation in all subjects [1]. A double-blind study with 25 patients with cervical SCI found that topical anorectal anesthesia with lidocaine significantly lowered systolic blood pressure during bowel manipulation, suggesting its effectiveness in reducing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) [2]. However, a case study of a parturient woman with SCI suggested that spinal anesthesia may be more effective than epidural anesthesia in providing hemodynamic protection against AD during cesarean section [3]. Finally, a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with seven subjects with SCI above the T6 level found that the AD response to FES was not significantly different between the topical anesthetic and placebo conditions [4].

Autonomic dysreflexia is typically managed through a combination of lifestyle changes, medications to control high blood pressure, and in some cases, surgical interventions. However, each patient's situation is unique, and treatment plans are typically individualized. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment options.""","Yes, local analgesics can be effective in reducing autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury. Autonomic dysreflexia is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden and excessive sympathetic response to a noxious stimulus below the level of the spinal cord injury. Local analgesics, such as lidocaine or bupivacaine, can be used to block the transmission of pain signals from the site of the stimulus, thereby preventing the triggering of autonomic dysreflexia. However, it is important to note that the use of local analgesics should be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional, as they may have potential side effects and contraindications.","The papers suggest that local analgesics can be effective in reducing autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury. Broecker 1979 and Broecker 1980 found that low spinal anesthesia was completely successful in preventing autonomic dysreflexia during endoscopic urologic procedures. Krum 2005 found that the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, was effective in reducing the severity and duration of episodes of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients. Khastgir 2007 emphasizes the importance of recognizing and managing autonomic dysreflexia as a potentially life-threatening hypertensive medical emergency."," Several studies have investigated the role of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine, in reducing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in individuals with spinal cord injury. A pre-clinical study on rodents found that rectal application of lidocaine significantly reduced AD severity [1]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 26 patients with spinal cord injury demonstrated that lidocaine anal sphincter block reduced anorectal procedure-associated AD [2]. Another double-blind study on 25 patients with cervical spinal cord injury found that topical anorectal anesthesia with lidocaine minimized AD during bowel manipulation [4]. An observational cohort study reported a sustained decrease in systolic blood pressure in 45% of individuals with spinal cord injury after lidocaine instillation [6]. However, a clinical trial involving 13 participants with high-level spinal cord injury found that lidocaine lubricant increased the duration of bowel care and led to higher systolic arterial pressure, suggesting a higher burden of AD [5]. 

"," Evidence suggests that local analgesics, specifically lidocaine, can reduce autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury, although results may vary based on the method of application and individual patient factors [1,2,4,6]. However, one study indicates that lidocaine lubricant may increase the burden of AD during bowel care [5].

"," The use of local analgesics in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) has been studied in various contexts, including ejaculation, bowel manipulation, labor, and functional electrical stimulation (FES). In a study involving eight men with SCI, local anesthesia of the dorsal penile nerves inhibited ejaculation in all subjects [1]. A double-blind study with 25 patients with cervical SCI found that topical anorectal anesthesia with lidocaine significantly lowered systolic blood pressure during bowel manipulation, suggesting its effectiveness in reducing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) [2]. However, a case study of a parturient woman with SCI suggested that spinal anesthesia may be more effective than epidural anesthesia in providing hemodynamic protection against AD during cesarean section [3]. Finally, a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with seven subjects with SCI above the T6 level found that the AD response to FES was not significantly different between the topical anesthetic and placebo conditions [4].

","Local anesthetic medications may be used to reduce the risk of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in individuals with spinal cord injuries. A multidisciplinary team approach, which includes urologist, gastroenterologist, and spinal rehabilitation specialists, in addition to prophylactic measures such as careful positioning and inspection of skin lesions, can help prevent episodes of AD. Procedures and surgeries, such as urologic instrumentation, that may trigger an AD episode can be done with either general or regional anesthesia. Antihypertensive medications can also be used. Emerging evidence suggests anesthetic medications and gabapentin, as well as noninvasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, may also be beneficial in reducing the risk of AD but further research is needed.",0.7334452867507935,0.15463917525773194,0.1728251781105904,29.462569321896815,0.08666666666666667,1.0,0.0,0.4797234215192347,0.25466301913624745,0.7517943382263184,0.13664596273291926,0.18215880102040813,33.52427167592724,0.08648648648648649,0.9071428571428571,0.0,0.5204917310488106,0.26507200987408086,0.7550855278968811,0.163265306122449,0.1227808867570174,19.14901233905304,0.04859611231101512,1.0,0.0,0.5192461641161306,0.2824724609579858,0.7623435258865356,0.17500000000000002,0.1584053499108726,23.33500634014274,0.05934718100890208,1.0,0.0,0.5336909746391731,0.28385347581881337,0.7694646716117859,0.12765957446808512,0.2157041421437489,33.048291525944876,0.06486486486486487,0.8488930770864302,0.0,0.5287262565559812,0.2759473339025672,0.7419721484184265,0.1285714285714286,0.12192630124366652,20.616556911137778,0.05119825708061002,1.0,0.0,0.48612130673080167,0.2724594853866439,0.7476582527160645,0.14285714285714288,0.14300067768643746,23.597460987241398,0.06017191977077364,1.0,0.0,0.5001905889117292,0.2728085906775136,0.7406722903251648,0.10852713178294572,0.17241379310344826,31.48848771616836,0.04864864864864865,0.7592872947478747,0.0,0.4800141798953215,0.24574521349907796,0.7957332730293274,0.2078853046594982,0.21993281096512765,29.17502345501258,0.1247086247086247,1.0,0.0,0.5614718733432141,0.31445431105255767,0.8013778924942017,0.21259842519685038,0.2732130657931614,33.02572164581707,0.14343163538873996,1.0,0.0,0.5706129254342167,0.31703775493813857,0.7578961253166199,0.08928571428571429,0.19480519480519481,33.35491721138706,0.032432432432432434,0.793552178658383,0.0,0.5578299227989081,0.2650834883163602,0.726325511932373,0.13636363636363638,0.16956165012657093,29.391873191251154,0.07297297297297298,0.9825011330426492,0.0,0.4558003998051087,0.24331513825388196,0.7416540384292603,0.13065326633165827,0.15054090439553616,27.08797314073172,0.06626506024096386,1.0,0.0,0.4776287429310657,0.2510104690317255
emergency medicine,adult trauma,What is the optimal surgical treatment for Neer type IIB (IIC) distal clavicle fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the current treatment strategies for the treatment of Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures in terms of functional outcome and complication rates and to examine the most appropriate surgical method by comparing all the available surgical techniques and implants.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic review of the existing literature (2000-2021) in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Research Gate and Google Scholar using the general terms 'distal AND clavicle AND fracture' to capture as many reports as possible. The MINORS tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the nonrandomized studies. We categorized the reported surgical techniques into four main types: open or arthroscopic coracoclavicular (CC) stabilization, locking plate fixation with or without CC augmentation, hook plate fixation and acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) transfixation. We reported findings for two main outcomes: clinical results and complication rates categorized into major and minor.

RESULTS:
Our database search yielded a total of 630 records; 34 studies were appropriate for qualitative analysis. There were 790 patients, with a mean age of 40.1Â years, a female percentage of 37% and a mean follow-up period of 29.3Â months. In total, 132 patients received a hook plate, 252 received a locking plate, 368 received CC stabilization and 41 received transacromial transfixation. All studies were retrospective and had fair MINORS scores. Locking plate, CC stabilization and ACJ transfixation showed similar clinical results but were much better than hook plate fixation; CC augmentation did not significantly improve the outcome of locking plate fixation. The rate of major complications was similar among groups; hook plate and AC joint transfixation had the worst rates of minor complications. Open CC techniques were slightly better than arthroscopic techniques.

CONCLUSIONS:
The present systematic review for the optimal fixation method for Neer type IIB fractures of the distal clavicle showed similar major complication rates among techniques; the hook plate technique demonstrated inferior clinical results to other techniques. Open CC stabilization and locking plate fixation without CC augmentation seem to be the best available treatment options.",The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the current treatment strategies for the treatment of Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures in terms of functional outcome and complication rates and to examine the most appropriate surgical method by comparing all the available surgical techniques and implants.,"We performed a systematic review of the existing literature (2000-2021) in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

Open CC stabilization and locking plate fixation without CC augmentation seem to be the best available treatment options.," Multiple surgical treatments for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures have been studied, with mixed results. Studies with larger sample sizes, such as those by Yang et al. [5], Khan et al. [6], and Mochizuki et al. [7], reported good outcomes with single coracoclavicular suture fixation, anatomical distal clavicle plate fixation with titanium alloy cable system-augmented coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopy-assisted synthetic conoid ligament reconstruction with Zip Tight and fracture-site fixation with K-wire, respectively. These studies reported high union rates, good functional outcomes, and relatively low complication rates. Other studies with smaller sample sizes reported good outcomes with other techniques, such as triple button device [1], clavicle hook plate fixation [2], miniature locking plate with a single button [3], plate fixation and minimally invasive coracoclavicular stabilization using screw fixation [4], suspensory cortical button technique [11], indirect fracture fixation using nonabsorbable sutures [12], micro-movable and anatomical acromioclavicular plate [13], and modified tension band fixation and coracoclavicular stabilization [14]. However, these studies had small sample sizes and retrospective designs, limiting the strength of their evidence. Additionally, studies comparing different surgical techniques [9,10] found no significant differences in stability or load to failure among various methods.

TL;DR: Several surgical treatments for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures have been reported to yield good outcomes, including single coracoclavicular suture fixation, anatomical distal clavicle plate fixation with titanium alloy cable system-augmented coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopy-assisted synthetic conoid ligament reconstruction with Zip Tight and fracture-site fixation with K-wire. However, more robust studies are needed to determine the optimal surgical treatment.

Minimally invasive surgery using titanium cable has shown promising results, with patients achieving osseous union within 12 weeks and good functional recovery [1]. Similarly, fixation techniques such as the anatomic locking plate and coracoclavicular stabilization with suture endo-button technique (LPES), Tight-rope system, and clavicular hook plate have also demonstrated satisfactory clinical and radiological results [2,3,4]. Anatomical locking plate fixation combined with coracoclavicular ligament augmentation has also been associated with good functional outcomes and a low complication rate [5]. Another study suggested that the use of a triple button device resulted in good functional outcomes and allowed all patients to return to their previous activity [6]. Furthermore, pre-contoured locking plate osteosynthesis (PLPO) and coracoclavicular stabilization (CCS) using a TightRope have resulted in satisfactory clinical outcomes, but the PLPO group had a higher union rate and a lower complication rate [7]. The use of a combination of locked plate fixation and minimal-invasive coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction has also shown excellent clinical and radiological outcomes with a low complication rate [8]. However, some studies have reported complications with certain techniques, such as implant loosening and non-union with screw fixation [9], and shoulder stiffness and subacromial erosion with clavicle hook plate fixation [12].

TL;DR: There is no consensus on the optimal surgical treatment for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures, but minimally invasive techniques, fixation methods like LPES, Tight-rope system, clavicular hook plate, and anatomical locking plate fixation combined with coracoclavicular ligament augmentation have shown promising results.

This procedure involves repositioning the fractured bone fragments into their normal alignment and then using mechanical devices such as plates, screws, or pins to hold the fragments in place while healing occurs. This method is generally preferred due to its high success rate and low risk of complications. However, the specific surgical approach may vary depending on the patient's individual circumstances and the surgeon's expertise.","The optimal surgical treatment for Neer type IIB (IIC) distal clavicle fractures is typically open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a plate and screws. This procedure allows for anatomical reduction of the fracture and provides stability to promote proper healing. Other treatment options such as non-operative management or arthroscopic techniques may be considered in certain cases, but ORIF is generally recommended for optimal outcomes.","The papers suggest that there are several surgical options for treating Neer type IIB (IIC) distal clavicle fractures, with varying degrees of success. Li 2011 found that minimally invasive surgery using titanium cable was a good option for treating Neer IIB distal clavicle fractures, with early functional recovery and no requirement for revision surgery. Han 2017 found that anatomical locking plate fixation combined with suture anchor augmentation of the coracoclavicular ligament was associated with a satisfactory functional outcome and low complication rate. Panagopoulos 2022 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of various surgical techniques and found that open CC stabilization and locking plate fixation without CC augmentation seem to be the best available treatment options. Panagopoulos 2021 conducted a systematic review of coracoclavicular stabilization techniques and found that they demonstrate promising clinical outcomes, including effectiveness and safety."," Multiple surgical treatments for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures have been studied, with mixed results. Studies with larger sample sizes, such as those by Yang et al. [5], Khan et al. [6], and Mochizuki et al. [7], reported good outcomes with single coracoclavicular suture fixation, anatomical distal clavicle plate fixation with titanium alloy cable system-augmented coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopy-assisted synthetic conoid ligament reconstruction with Zip Tight and fracture-site fixation with K-wire, respectively. These studies reported high union rates, good functional outcomes, and relatively low complication rates. Other studies with smaller sample sizes reported good outcomes with other techniques, such as triple button device [1], clavicle hook plate fixation [2], miniature locking plate with a single button [3], plate fixation and minimally invasive coracoclavicular stabilization using screw fixation [4], suspensory cortical button technique [11], indirect fracture fixation using nonabsorbable sutures [12], micro-movable and anatomical acromioclavicular plate [13], and modified tension band fixation and coracoclavicular stabilization [14]. However, these studies had small sample sizes and retrospective designs, limiting the strength of their evidence. Additionally, studies comparing different surgical techniques [9,10] found no significant differences in stability or load to failure among various methods.

"," Several surgical treatments for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures have been reported to yield good outcomes, including single coracoclavicular suture fixation, anatomical distal clavicle plate fixation with titanium alloy cable system-augmented coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopy-assisted synthetic conoid ligament reconstruction with Zip Tight and fracture-site fixation with K-wire. However, more robust studies are needed to determine the optimal surgical treatment.

"," The optimal surgical treatment for Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures remains a matter of debate, with various studies suggesting different techniques. Minimally invasive surgery using titanium cable has shown promising results, with patients achieving osseous union within 12 weeks and good functional recovery [1]. Similarly, fixation techniques such as the anatomic locking plate and coracoclavicular stabilization with suture endo-button technique (LPES), Tight-rope system, and clavicular hook plate have also demonstrated satisfactory clinical and radiological results [2,3,4]. Anatomical locking plate fixation combined with coracoclavicular ligament augmentation has also been associated with good functional outcomes and a low complication rate [5]. Another study suggested that the use of a triple button device resulted in good functional outcomes and allowed all patients to return to their previous activity [6]. Furthermore, pre-contoured locking plate osteosynthesis (PLPO) and coracoclavicular stabilization (CCS) using a TightRope have resulted in satisfactory clinical outcomes, but the PLPO group had a higher union rate and a lower complication rate [7]. The use of a combination of locked plate fixation and minimal-invasive coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction has also shown excellent clinical and radiological outcomes with a low complication rate [8]. However, some studies have reported complications with certain techniques, such as implant loosening and non-union with screw fixation [9], and shoulder stiffness and subacromial erosion with clavicle hook plate fixation [12].

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Should Arthroscopic Bone Marrow Stimulation Be Used in the Management of Secondary Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common, particularly after trauma. Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation has emerged as the first-choice surgical treatment for small primary lesions less than 100 mm2. Individual studies on the topic are small and heterogeneous, and they have differed in their main findings; for this reason, systematically reviewing the available evidence seems important.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review, we asked: (1) What patient-reported outcomes and pain scores have been observed after arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus? (2) What complications were reported? (3) What demographic and clinical factors were reported to be associated with better patient-reported outcome scores?

METHODS:
We performed a systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using Embase, EmCare, PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus (databases last searched June 23, 2021). A two-stage title/abstract and full-text screening process was performed independently by two reviewers. Randomized control trials, cohort studies, and observational studies published in English that evaluated the outcome of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus were included. Case reports, review articles, commentaries, abstracts, and letters to the editor were excluded. A total of 12 articles (10 case series and two retrospective comparative studies) involving 446 patients were included. Of these, 111 patients with a mean age of 33 years (range 20 to 49) received arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for a secondary osteochondral lesion of the talus. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria were used to assess the methodologic quality of included studies. The MINORS is a numerical score ranging from 0 to 16 for studies with no comparison group and 0 to 24 for comparative studies, with higher quality studies receiving higher scores. Of the 10 noncomparative case series, the highest score was 10 of 16, with a median (range) score of 7.5 (4 to 10), while the two comparative studies scored 22 of 24 and 19 of 24, respectively.

RESULTS:
Studies varied widely in terms of patient-reported outcome measures such as the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS), with inconsistent reporting across studies regarding whether or how much patients improved; there was variation in some effect sizes with regard to improvement seeming close to or below the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Although no perioperative complications were reported in any included studies, 34% (26 of 77, in seven studies that reported on this endpoint) of patients who underwent a revision procedure. One study found a negative association between lesion size and AOFAS and VAS score. No other studies reported on factors associated with patient-reported outcome scores, and most studies were far too small to explore relationships of this sort.

CONCLUSION:
We found that arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus yielded inconsistent and often small improvements in patient-reported outcomes, with approximately one in three patients undergoing a revision procedure. Reported outcomes likely represent a best-case scenario, inflated by low-level study designs and major sources of bias that are known to make treatment effects seem larger than they are. Therefore, the use of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation in such patients cannot be recommended, unless we are able to refine selection criteria to effectively identify patients who show a substantial clinical benefit.

A systematic review involving 70 patients demonstrated a clinical success rate of 61% and a return to sport and work rates of 83% and 92% respectively [1]. A randomized controlled trial with 60 patients showed a 90% sports participation rate at a mean follow-up of 6.4 years [2]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis involving 323 ankles reported a mean postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 83.8, with 78% of patients participating in sports at final follow-up [3]. A cohort study involving 46 patients comparing primary osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) and secondary OAT after failed marrow stimulation found no significant differences in clinical outcomes [4]. Another study found that hyaluronic acid (HA) injections may provide better clinical outcomes than other conservative treatments in patients with OLT who had previously undergone arthroscopic microfracture surgery [5]. Lastly, a matched cohort study found no significant differences in clinical, sports, work, and radiological outcomes between primary and secondary OLTs at 1-year follow-up [8].

TL;DR: Based on the available evidence, Arthroscopic Bone Marrow Stimulation can be effective in managing secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus, with significant rates of return to sport and work, although long-term outcomes and comparison with other treatments may require further investigation.

The technique has shown satisfactory clinical outcomes, particularly for smaller lesions less than 1 cm in diameter or 150 mm(2) [3,5,10,12]. However, the management of larger lesions, cystic changes, uncontained lesions, or lesions resistant to treatment may require alternative or additional interventions such as autologous osteochondral transplantation, allograft transplantation, or augmentation with extracellular matrix cartilage allograft [1,2,4,12]. Furthermore, some studies suggest that outcomes of BMS may be influenced by factors such as patient age, lesion depth, and location [5,8]. Biologic augmentation strategies, including platelet-rich plasma and concentrated bone marrow aspirate, have also been considered for improving clinical and radiological outcomes, but evidence is still emerging [11,16]. The majority of the articles cited do not provide detailed information about study design, sample size, or study population, limiting the strength of the evidence [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16].

TL;DR: Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation may be beneficial for managing smaller secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus, but alternative or additional interventions may be required for larger or complex lesions. The strength of evidence is limited due to lack of details on study design and sample size in many studies.

However, a systematic review including 446 patients suggested that arthroscopic BMS cannot be recommended unless selection criteria are refined due to inconsistent reporting on improvements and complications in 34% of patients who underwent a revision procedure [8]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 310 patients showed satisfactory clinical outcomes with arthroscopic BMS, but there was a risk of progression of degenerative changes and development of ankle osteoarthritis over time [7].

It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.","The papers present mixed findings on whether arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (BMS) should be used in the management of secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus. Arshad 2022 conducted a systematic review and found that arthroscopic BMS yielded inconsistent and often small improvements in patient-reported outcomes, with approximately one in three patients undergoing a revision procedure. Murawski 2010 suggests that arthroscopic BMS should be confined to smaller lesions, while larger lesions should be treated with osteochondral autograft transplant (OATS). Park 2018 found that arthroscopic BMS for osteochondral lesions of the talus had satisfactory clinical outcomes through long-term follow-up over 10 years. Hannon 2016 found that arthroscopic BMS with concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA) resulted in similar functional outcomes and improved border repair tissue integration, with less evidence of fissuring and fibrillation on MRI. Overall, the papers suggest that arthroscopic BMS may be effective for smaller lesions, but larger lesions may require other treatments such as OATS."," Arthroscopic Bone Marrow Stimulation (BMS) has been evaluated in several studies for the management of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). A systematic review involving 70 patients demonstrated a clinical success rate of 61% and a return to sport and work rates of 83% and 92% respectively [1]. A randomized controlled trial with 60 patients showed a 90% sports participation rate at a mean follow-up of 6.4 years [2]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis involving 323 ankles reported a mean postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 83.8, with 78% of patients participating in sports at final follow-up [3]. A cohort study involving 46 patients comparing primary osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) and secondary OAT after failed marrow stimulation found no significant differences in clinical outcomes [4]. Another study found that hyaluronic acid (HA) injections may provide better clinical outcomes than other conservative treatments in patients with OLT who had previously undergone arthroscopic microfracture surgery [5]. Lastly, a matched cohort study found no significant differences in clinical, sports, work, and radiological outcomes between primary and secondary OLTs at 1-year follow-up [8].

"," Based on the available evidence, Arthroscopic Bone Marrow Stimulation can be effective in managing secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus, with significant rates of return to sport and work, although long-term outcomes and comparison with other treatments may require further investigation.

"," Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (BMS) has been widely discussed as a treatment option for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). The technique has shown satisfactory clinical outcomes, particularly for smaller lesions less than 1 cm in diameter or 150 mm(2) [3,5,10,12]. However, the management of larger lesions, cystic changes, uncontained lesions, or lesions resistant to treatment may require alternative or additional interventions such as autologous osteochondral transplantation, allograft transplantation, or augmentation with extracellular matrix cartilage allograft [1,2,4,12]. Furthermore, some studies suggest that outcomes of BMS may be influenced by factors such as patient age, lesion depth, and location [5,8]. Biologic augmentation strategies, including platelet-rich plasma and concentrated bone marrow aspirate, have also been considered for improving clinical and radiological outcomes, but evidence is still emerging [11,16]. The majority of the articles cited do not provide detailed information about study design, sample size, or study population, limiting the strength of the evidence [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16].

"," Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation may be beneficial for managing smaller secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus, but alternative or additional interventions may be required for larger or complex lesions. The strength of evidence is limited due to lack of details on study design and sample size in many studies.

"," The use of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (BMS) in the management of secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) has been studied extensively. A retrospective analysis of a previously published randomized-controlled trial showed that 90% of patients still participated in sports activities after BMS, and the Activity Assessment Scale (AAS) scores were similar pre- and post-injury [2]. However, a systematic review including 446 patients suggested that arthroscopic BMS cannot be recommended unless selection criteria are refined due to inconsistent reporting on improvements and complications in 34% of patients who underwent a revision procedure [8]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis including 310 patients showed satisfactory clinical outcomes with arthroscopic BMS, but there was a risk of progression of degenerative changes and development of ankle osteoarthritis over time [7]. A study comparing primary and secondary osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) found no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups [1]. Another study showed that hyaluronic acid (HA) injections may provide better clinical outcomes than other conservative treatments in patients who had previously undergone arthroscopic microfracture surgery [6].

"," Current evidence suggests that arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation may provide satisfactory clinical outcomes in patients with secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus, but there is a risk of progression of degenerative changes. Therefore, its use should be carefully considered and may depend on individual patient characteristics and circumstances.

","Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation (ABMS) may be an appropriate method for managing secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs), as it is an effective treatment for OLT lesions under 150 mm in size. MRI is regularly used for diagnoses and to prepare for surgery; however, discrepancies between OLT size on MRI and the actual size seen with arthroscopy have been reported, so it is important to educate patients on the possibility of the actual size being different. Osteochondral allograft transplantation is recommended for larger symptomatic lesions, while smaller lesions can be treated with autograft or microfracture techniques. When performing arthroscopy for OLTs, it is important to take into account the location of nearby neurovascular structures to avoid accidental injury. Bone morphogenic proteins, autologous bone grafts, electrostimulation, and various transplant therapies may be used to manage congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Intravenous BMC injections combined with iloprost can help proliferate fracture healing, while intra-articular BMC injections can improve chewing and pain relief. All these treatments can help to improve the patient’s quality of life.",0.7737042307853699,0.18072289156626506,0.33336562736062325,42.63911028828992,0.08668076109936575,0.7838657578758522,0.0,0.6275393124137606,0.2834853838818766,0.7744872570037842,0.16363636363636364,0.303027875881368,40.82766894024633,0.0824524312896406,0.7748922630519383,0.0,0.6135798721477903,0.2857823574445823,0.7885029911994934,0.18502202643171806,0.27273842421027,42.82742429511385,0.11878453038674033,0.9029093369418133,0.0,0.6063690695184223,0.30321675345007887,0.7865073680877686,0.1902439024390244,0.27094596337359533,43.95936138290046,0.12050739957716702,0.7661142464432827,0.0,0.6105915994095288,0.3029437924303337,0.7720479965209961,0.1297709923664122,0.3570253655215423,31.607403594322875,0.03699788583509514,0.8904848647067862,0.0,0.6640269447456707,0.27999025157144003,0.7700412273406982,0.15212527964205816,0.2265838222210255,38.62657571993025,0.10547667342799188,0.842617120872107,0.0,0.5738803839300111,0.28939885198233134,0.7627122402191162,0.1414141414141414,0.23515817307375336,39.073998813829355,0.09725158562367865,0.8003089077513976,0.0,0.5609005835942843,0.28456761612275794,0.788676381111145,0.14869888475836432,0.2944553914731257,32.87957181618527,0.04334038054968287,0.8559484817730758,0.0,0.70509172976017,0.2975719519626046,0.8068206906318665,0.19153674832962142,0.2957809303800391,46.29209183770177,0.1586998087954111,0.8474821186932148,0.0,0.6359003576299102,0.3146649427760793,0.8089452981948853,0.2005012531328321,0.3457478937347282,48.95929448145691,0.1511627906976744,0.7420270573370255,0.0,0.6422283752606466,0.31627608870042884,0.7868938446044922,0.1492537313432836,0.3175767398049646,36.538839220124245,0.05708245243128964,0.8647222954742916,0.0,0.6916958401280064,0.29235746620318054,0.8091899752616882,0.2328042328042328,0.32783103269008435,48.75548702122881,0.1744186046511628,0.6720374284343555,0.0,0.6715977292764803,0.3209916002357524,0.7644411325454712,0.14683544303797466,0.2098028870033815,40.838404162103906,0.08668076109936575,0.7708766988536948,0.0,0.5788364956591652,0.2827366477148432
emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does the critical shoulder angle decrease after acromioplasty? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common shoulder injuries in the older population. This study aimed to determine whether acromioplasty reliably decreases the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and describe any associated complications.

METHODS:
A systematic literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library Database. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts using prespecified criteria. Studies where the acromioplasty was performed as a surgical procedure were included. Patient characteristics and degree of CSA reduction were collected from each individual study. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4.1 software. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.

RESULTS:
A total of 9 studies involving 1236 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The age of patients ranged from 23 to 82Â years. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 30Â months. Of the 9 studies, 8 (88.9%) were retrospective, 1 (11.1%) was prospective, 5 were comparative, and 4 were case series. The mean CSA was significantly reduced from 36.1Â°âÂ±â4.6Â° to 33.7Â°âÂ±â4.2 (pâ<â0.05). The meta-analysis showed an overall best estimate of the mean difference in pre- and postoperative CSA equal to 2.63Â° (95% confidence interval: 2.15, 3.11] (pâ<â0.00001).

CONCLUSIONS:
Acromioplasty can significantly reduce CSA, notably in cases of high preoperative CSA. In addition, the effect of lateral acromioplasty on the CSA was more significant compared to anterolateral acromioplasty. Acromioplasty was not associated with complications during the short-term follow-up.",Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common shoulder injuries in the older population.

A study involving 435 subjects found that anterolateral acromioplasty did not significantly change the overall CSA, but did significantly reduce it in patients with a pathological CSA >35Â° [7]. A similar study involving 102 patients found a significant decrease in CSA after isolated arthroscopic acromioplasty, particularly in patients with a preoperative CSA >35Â° [4].

Acromioplasty is a surgical procedure commonly performed to treat shoulder impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tears. It involves removing a small portion of the acromion, which is the bony prominence on the scapula (shoulder blade). By removing this portion, the shape of the acromion can be altered, leading to a decrease in the critical shoulder angle. This can help alleviate impingement of the rotator cuff tendons and improve shoulder function. However, it is important to note that the critical shoulder angle is just one factor that can contribute to shoulder impingement, and the success of acromioplasty may vary depending on individual patient factors.","All four papers suggest that the critical shoulder angle (CSA) decreases after acromioplasty.

Notably, the largest study [6] found that the CSA significantly decreased from 38.4Â° Â± 6.0Â° before surgery to 35.8Â° Â± 5.9Â° after surgery in 337 patients. A systematic review [5] also reported a positive correlation between clinical results and decreased CSA. However, it is worth noting that the majority of these studies were retrospective, potentially introducing biases such as selection bias and confounding factors [1][2][4][6][9][11][12].

"," Based on the available evidence, the critical shoulder angle generally decreases after acromioplasty, but the degree of reduction and whether it reaches a non-pathologic range may vary.

"," The critical shoulder angle (CSA) is an important parameter associated with conditions such as rotator cuff tears and osteoarthritis. Several studies have investigated whether acromioplasty, a surgical intervention, can effectively reduce the CSA. Retrospective studies with large sample sizes have generally found that acromioplasty can lead to a decrease in CSA. A study involving 435 subjects found that anterolateral acromioplasty did not significantly change the overall CSA, but did significantly reduce it in patients with a pathological CSA >35Â° [7]. A similar study involving 102 patients found a significant decrease in CSA after isolated arthroscopic acromioplasty, particularly in patients with a preoperative CSA >35Â° [4]. Another retrospective study involving 90 patients found that anterior acromioplasty significantly reduced the CSA [10]. However, some studies found that despite a reduction in CSA, the desired range of 30Â°-35Â° was not always achieved [17]. A cadaveric study also suggested that lateral acromioplasty might be more effective than anterolateral acromioplasty in reducing CSA [11]. It is important to note that these studies were mostly retrospective in nature, which may introduce bias, and the lack of control groups in most studies limits the ability to establish causality.

"," Based on the available evidence, acromioplasty generally leads to a decrease in the critical shoulder angle, but the desired range may not always be achieved. The type of acromioplasty may also influence the degree of reduction.

"," Several retrospective studies and a meta-analysis provide evidence that acromioplasty can lead to a decrease in the critical shoulder angle (CSA) [2][3][4][5][10][11][12][13][14]. The meta-analysis included nine studies involving 1236 patients and found a significant reduction in the mean CSA after acromioplasty [4]. Other studies, with sample sizes ranging from 36 to 435 patients, also reported significant reductions in the CSA following acromioplasty [2][3][5][10][11][12][13][14]. However, a few studies have suggested that not all acromioplasty techniques are equally effective in reducing the CSA [1][7][8]. For instance, lateral acromioplasty techniques based on the lateral acromial border did not replicate the ideal resection, potentially leading to excessive deltoid release [2]. Additionally, one study found that acromioplasty did not result in significant reductions in mean CSA compared to preoperative measures [7]. Furthermore, in some cases, the CSA did not normalize even after acromioplasty, particularly in patients with a preoperative CSA >35Â° [8][12][13][14]. 

"," The evidence generally suggests that acromioplasty can lead to a decrease in the critical shoulder angle, but the extent of reduction may vary depending on the specific surgical technique used and the preoperative CSA.

","No, the critical shoulder angle does not decrease after acromioplasty. A shoulder arthroplasty could potentially change its biomechanics, but the critical shoulder angle is assessed by a plain radiograph of the shoulder, measuring the extent of lateral coverage by the acromion and the inclination of the glenoid. In the setting of chronic anterior instability, a palpable anterior fullness can be observed, as well as corresponding posterior and anterior acromial prominences. A diagnosis of acromioclavicular joint injury can be made by X-rays, compared against a contralateral shoulder, and with optionally weighted stress views, ultrasound, or MRI.",0.7817263007164001,0.1045751633986928,0.08843981219476407,19.85373923233327,0.04417670682730924,1.0,0.0,0.5418225534451313,0.29396389741848206,0.7894756197929382,0.1111111111111111,0.19430051813471502,31.987075664388627,0.08235294117647059,0.8001625223468227,0.0,0.5545712918677228,0.28940891931001794,0.7707024812698364,0.10526315789473686,0.08141294609127804,18.131019742069057,0.035641547861507125,1.0,0.0,0.47178881750865415,0.28865180513139127,0.7703098058700562,0.11111111111111112,0.09595311703212647,20.619584744348533,0.03900709219858156,1.0,0.0,0.4733550866332018,0.28816597102550157,0.7972065806388855,0.11594202898550725,0.1592356687898089,28.778305161964884,0.06470588235294118,0.7605233219567691,0.0,0.5690344999998044,0.29704886582948986,0.8133226633071899,0.14022140221402213,0.07775861780315077,15.36543805760735,0.038752362948960305,1.0,0.0,0.5703193235519695,0.32803882497930653,0.8148635029792786,0.1459227467811159,0.09038352046470488,17.821985907106647,0.04421768707482993,1.0,0.0,0.578722975575007,0.33075148905137725,0.8239396810531616,0.15584415584415584,0.23287631497524758,30.600752582048756,0.09411764705882353,0.8061054228289724,0.0,0.6353280794620514,0.32159170178041663,0.7814229726791382,0.13821138211382114,0.06611596409746086,16.72010626307447,0.0296229802513465,1.0,0.0,0.5116218428401386,0.3057231914823084,0.7809966802597046,0.1523809523809524,0.07463954426295624,19.680069245222263,0.031446540880503145,1.0,0.0,0.5153734410462314,0.30708111767672003,0.8106029033660889,0.21333333333333335,0.21433624903524567,33.72865896682654,0.1,0.7888225255972696,0.0,0.60181844373082,0.31492020556699524,0.8526355028152466,0.22556390977443613,0.2016329968675352,30.164380137583457,0.11330049261083744,1.0,0.0,0.6745603951350064,0.35577206091900204,0.7955551147460938,0.11678832116788321,0.09757376781189549,22.511823427035544,0.04929577464788732,1.0,0.0,0.5377738031980802,0.2970740635388996
emergency medicine,adult trauma,What is the impact of a fast-track pathway on length of stay for adult patients with a hip fracture? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
In orthopaedic surgery, hip fracture patients represent one of the largest cohorts. Hip fracture is a serious injury commonly occurring in frail and elderly patients. Fast-track admission pathways aim to streamline patients through accident and emergency departments, resulting in shorter wait times and less negative patient outcomes.

AIM:
To examine the impact of a fast-track pathway on length of stay for adults admitted to an acute hospital with a hip fracture.

METHODS:
CINAHL Plus with Full text (via EBSCO host), MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase database searches were carried out in January 2021, to find all relevant literature for this review, as well as through searching additional sources. Eligible studies were quantitative primary research, focusing on the use of fast-track admission pathway care versus usual care, for adults with a hip fracture. The assessment of study suitability, data extraction, and critical appraisal was carried out by two independent authors. A narrative analysis of the data was conducted, and data were meta-analysed using RevMan where possible. Quality appraisal of the included studies was undertaken using the EBL checklist.

RESULTS:
Seven studies reporting data on 5723 patients were included. Length of stay, time to surgery, and mortality did not differ significantly between the fast-track care, and usual care. One study reported on delirium and found statistically significantly fewer encounters of delirium in fast-track care versus usual care. Four of the seven studies satisfied rigorous quality appraisal (>â75%) using the EBL.

CONCLUSION:
The fast-track pathway avoided unnecessary delays in emergency departments due to faster X-rays, direct admission to orthopaedic wards, and reduced delirium rates. However, results were unable to show the impact of fast-track on length of stay, time to surgery, and mortality.","In orthopaedic surgery, hip fracture patients represent one of the largest cohorts.

Similarly, a retrospective single-center study involving 1820 patients found that fast-track care resulted in significantly shorter length of stay and time to surgery, with no significant differences in mortality and readmission rate [4]. A systematic review of seven studies involving 5723 patients found no significant difference between fast-track care and usual care in terms of length of stay, time to surgery, and mortality, but did find that fast-track care had significantly fewer encounters of delirium [5]. A prospective, observational, single-center cohort study also found that fast-track care significantly reduced length of stay in post-acute rehabilitation and total length of stay [6]. However, a prehospital randomized controlled study of 400 patients found no significant differences between fast-track care and traditional care in terms of length of stay [3].

"," Most studies suggest that fast-track pathways can reduce the length of hospital stay for adult patients with hip fractures, without increasing adverse events or mortality, although some studies found no significant difference.

","Fast-track pathways for adult hip fracture patients have been found to reduce length of stay in hospital. Early operative intervention is preferred to restore mobilization status, reduce mortality rates, and improve outcomes. Hyper-acute surgery (within 6 hours) does not affect mortality or major complications, but can reduce delirium and reduce length of stay by one day. Comorbidities, advanced age, and restricted ambulatory status can complicate hip fracture management and make successful outcomes more difficult. Mortality increases with age and is higher in males. Overall mortality is 30% with a1-year follow-up. Fast-track pathways can be helpful in reducing length of stay, but should be handled with care as they carry the risk of complications.",0.7870203852653503,0.2076502732240437,0.21383207841541174,36.30736180450559,0.09069767441860466,0.8105776972624799,0.0,0.5957359768966637,0.29121368242432094,0.7868877649307251,0.18181818181818182,0.23366024783384307,37.846816497346154,0.12790697674418605,0.8734961763947271,0.0,0.5840965881943703,0.292042849066887,0.7925117611885071,0.18421052631578946,0.1619496731178186,26.84689028893199,0.08542141230068337,1.0,0.0,0.5772230468718942,0.29692162709023207,0.7927754521369934,0.18867924528301885,0.19711782784405776,30.89117401157654,0.09436619718309859,1.0,0.0,0.5835584184085881,0.29808534488827426,0.7774416208267212,0.1791044776119403,0.21064301552106432,35.15573051557416,0.05116279069767442,0.8097311683664341,0.0,0.6180443041026592,0.2789143222155426,0.7866660952568054,0.18685121107266436,0.1413427561837456,26.83273208295192,0.06779661016949153,1.0,0.0,0.5766333457210968,0.2924316745296657,0.7899033427238464,0.19305019305019303,0.14845605700712589,30.001057270195748,0.07348703170028818,1.0,0.0,0.5837710850244883,0.2935406126779402,0.7671050429344177,0.128,0.18918918918918923,31.593515745771413,0.02558139534883721,0.8326571442513472,0.0,0.6031411857374253,0.27275540855815156,0.8228124380111694,0.25,0.17554603100786917,26.769552889386674,0.11516314779270634,1.0,0.0,0.6169243025839528,0.3229845439310137,0.8288379907608032,0.26578073089700993,0.23629971129020397,30.809554645972558,0.1343115124153499,1.0,0.0,0.6342411620491674,0.3288592364459601,0.7915307879447937,0.12307692307692307,0.18867924528301885,36.014385888900925,0.027906976744186046,0.7948388674860882,0.0,0.6257615427713137,0.2852756239390965,0.8171124458312988,0.26666666666666666,0.24179301471930648,36.527977754801825,0.12199312714776632,1.0,0.0,0.6299859002320725,0.31517559428598935,0.7951061725616455,0.18604651162790697,0.20448500788713367,32.442590761039284,0.0945945945945946,0.9273521969174142,0.0,0.5836103473966187,0.29716571345769593
emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does Biceps Tenotomy or Tenodesis Have Better Results After Surgery? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Although tenotomy and tenodesis are frequently used for long head of the biceps tendon lesions, controversies remain as to which technique is superior regarding pain, functionality, complications, and cosmetic appearance.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
(1) For long head of biceps tendon lesions, does tenotomy or tenodesis result in greater improvements in VAS score for pain? (2) Which approach has superior results when evaluating function outcome (Constant) scores? (3) Does tenotomy or tenodesis have fewer complications? (4) Does tenotomy or tenodesis result in better cosmesis (Popeye sign)?

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed in the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em CiÃªncias da SaÃºde (LILACS) using the keywords ""long head of the biceps tendon,"" ""biceps tenodesis,"" and ""tenotomy."" We completed the search in June 2020. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and quasirandomized controlled trials that investigated tenodesis and tenotomy with no language restriction and evaluation of adult patients who presented with a long head of the biceps tendon lesion, associated with other lesions or not, without previous shoulder surgeries and who had no response to nonoperative treatment. The initial search yielded 239 studies, 40 of which were duplicates. We assessed the titles and abstracts of 199 articles and excluded all studies that were not randomized controlled trials (literature reviews) or that compared different techniques. We assessed the full text of 14 articles and excluded the ones that were protocols and cohort studies. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. We included eight studies in this systematic review and meta-analysis, with a total of 615 participants, 306 of whom were treated with tenotomy and 309 with tenodesis. The median duration of follow-up was 2 years. Overall, the included studies had a low risk of bias. The complications evaluated were adhesive capsulitis, biceps brachii tear, cramps, and a subsequent second surgical procedure. We used a random model in this meta-analysis so that we could generalize the results beyond the included studies. In this study, we only reported differences between the groups if they were both statistically valid and larger than the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).

RESULTS:
Comparing tenotomy and tenodesis, we observed no difference between the groups regarding pain in the long term (mean difference 0.25 [95% confidence interval -0.29 to 0.80]; p = 0.36). There was no difference in Constant score in the long-term (mean difference -1.45 [95% CI -2.96 to 0.06]; p = 0.06). There were no differences when evaluating for major complications (odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI 0.29 to 6.56]; p = 0.70). There were not enough papers evaluating adhesive capsulitis, cramping, and risk of revision surgery. Popeye sign was more frequent in the tenotomy group than in the tenodesis group (OR 4.70 [95% CI 2.71 to 8.17]; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:
This systematic review demonstrated that tenotomy and tenodesis offer satisfactory treatment for long head of the biceps tendon lesions. In terms of pain improvement and Constant score, there was no difference between the techniques, but patients undergoing tenotomy have worse cosmetic results. Therefore, surgeons should choose the technique based on their skills and the patient's expectations of surgery, such as cosmesis and time to recovery. More studies are needed to evaluate complications such as adhesive capsulitis and cramping, as well as to compare duration of surgery and recovery time for each technique.

Both procedures have been found to provide good subjective outcomes and significant improvements in pain and function [1][16]. However, tenotomy has been associated with a higher incidence of cosmetic deformity (Popeye sign) and cramping pain in the bicipital groove muscle [4][16][17][18]. Tenodesis, on the other hand, can result in complications such as loss of fixation, residual groove pain, infection, stiffness, hematoma, neurologic injury, vascular injury, proximal humerus fracture, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy [18]. A randomized controlled trial involving 114 participants found no significant difference in post-operative functional outcomes between the two procedures, but reported a higher rate of Popeye deformity in the tenotomy group [16]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine studies involving 650 patients found no significant difference in functional outcomes but a lower incidence of Popeye deformity and cramping pain in the tenodesis group [17]. A systematic review of 11 studies found better results with tenodesis in terms of Popeye's sign, satisfaction, and forearm supination strength [7]. However, there was no difference between the two procedures regarding biceps cramping [7].

TL;DR: Based on the available evidence, both biceps tenotomy and tenodesis can provide good subjective outcomes and improvements in pain and function. However, tenodesis may result in better cosmetic outcomes and less cramping pain, although it can be associated with a range of complications. The choice between the two procedures should be individualized based on patient characteristics and surgeon preference.

The choice between the two depends on various factors, including the patient's age, activity level, and the specific condition being treated.

Biceps tenotomy involves cutting the long head of the biceps tendon, while tenodesis involves reattaching the tendon to another location, typically the humerus bone. 

Studies have shown that both procedures can provide satisfactory outcomes in terms of pain relief and functional improvement. However, there is no clear consensus on which procedure has better results overall.

Some studies suggest that biceps tenodesis may have advantages in terms of improved cosmetic appearance, reduced risk of Popeye deformity (bulging of the biceps muscle), and potentially better long-term outcomes in younger, active patients. 

On the other hand, biceps tenotomy is a simpler procedure with a shorter recovery time and may be more suitable for older or less active individuals.

Ultimately, the choice between biceps tenotomy and tenodesis should be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration the patient's specific needs and preferences, as well as the surgeon's expertise and experience. It is important for patients to discuss the potential risks, benefits, and expected outcomes with their healthcare provider before making a decision.","The papers have mixed findings on whether biceps tenotomy or tenodesis has better results after surgery.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,"Is the Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) Associated with Risk of Time-Loss Injury in Professional Team Sports? A Systematic Review of Methodology, Variables and Injury Risk in Practical Situations.","BACKGROUND:
The acute: chronic workload ratio (ACWR) is an index of the acute workload relative to the cumulative chronic workloads. The monitoring of physical workloads using the ACWR has emerged and been hypothesized as a useful tool for coaches and athletes to optimize performance while aiming to reduce the risk of potentially preventable load-driven injuries.

OBJECTIVES:
Our goal was to describe characteristics of the ACWR and investigate the association of the ACWR with the risk of time-loss injuries in adult elite team sport athletes.

DATA SOURCES:
PubMed, EMBASE and grey literature databases; inception to May 2019.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
Longitudinal studies that assess the relationship of the ACWR and time-loss injury risk in adult professional or elite team sports.

METHODS:
We summarized the population characteristics, workload metrics and ACWR calculation methods. For each workload metric, we plotted the risk estimates for the ACWR in isolation, or when combined with chronic workloads. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black scale.

RESULTS:
Twenty studies comprising 2375 injuries from 1234 athletes (all males and mean age of 24Â years) from different sports were included. Internal (65%) and external loads (70%) were collected in more than half of the studies and the session-rating of perceived exertion and total distance were the most commonly collected metrics. The ACWR was commonly calculated using the coupled method (95%), 1:4 weekly blocks (95%) and subsequent week injury lag (80%). There were 14 different binning methods with almost none of the studies using the same binning categories.

CONCLUSION:
The majority of studies suggest that athletes are at greater risk of sustaining a time-loss injury when the ACWR is higher relative to a lower or moderate ACWR. The heterogenous methodological approaches not only reflect the wide range of sports studied and the differing demands of these activities, but also limit the strength of recommendations.

Several studies found a significant association between high ACWR and increased injury risk in collegiate football, elite Gaelic football, competitive running, and junior tennis players [1,2,4,5]. However, a study on elite junior Australian football players found a relatively flat-line association between ACWR and injury [3]. Additionally, a cluster-randomized controlled trial in elite youth footballers found that a load management intervention using ACWR did not significantly reduce the prevalence of health problems [6]. A systematic review of 22 studies found evidence supporting the association between ACWR and non-contact injuries, suggesting ACWR is a valuable tool for monitoring training load [12]. However, the review also highlighted the need for further research to explore the applicability of the ACWR in different sports, time frames, and populations [12].

Malone 2017 found that an ACWR of between 1.00 and 1.25 is protective for professional soccer players. Maupin 2020 found that utilizing ACWR for external and internal loads may be related to injury risk, and calculating ACWR using exponentially weighted moving averages may result in a more sensitive measure. Griffin 2019 supports the association between the ACWR and non-contact injuries and its use as a valuable tool for monitoring training load as part of a larger scale multifaceted monitoring system that includes other proven methods.

","The Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) is associated with the risk of time-loss injury in professional team sports. Studies have found that acute injuries, such as shoulder injuries resulting from collision sports such as football, lacrosse, and ice hockey, can cause long-term instability or pain, with nearly 74% of patients experiencing chronic symptoms up to four years after initial injury. A prospective study by Dickens et al. also found that up to 27% of athletes in Division I colleges could not complete their season due to injury, suggesting a need for better monitoring of workloads. The literature also suggests that when injury occurs through workplace accidents, the results may be worse than for non-workplace injuries. Thus, assessing the ACWR in professional team sports can help reduce the risk of time-loss injury for athletes.",0.7910414934158325,0.2105263157894737,0.14563106796116504,24.647096837969627,0.06572769953051644,1.0,0.0,0.5827547531511824,0.2956856718592401,0.7894121408462524,0.19753086419753085,0.16936459270927093,25.137056001514846,0.07488986784140969,1.0,0.0,0.5807845100308909,0.2957157888942181,0.7560110688209534,0.1568627450980392,0.09419454785065792,14.996793227571404,0.041758241758241756,1.0,0.0,0.5077881726657371,0.2745912122599657,0.7596321702003479,0.14563106796116504,0.11179953045683827,17.32353908666184,0.04105571847507331,1.0,0.0,0.5139739803014658,0.2730991546355207,0.7987042665481567,0.17475728155339804,0.24178930445382754,35.03984247567492,0.11504424778761062,0.7891009852216748,0.0,0.5836630599540577,0.2890617927396787,0.7455481886863708,0.1506276150627615,0.11398634172469202,16.08651225661488,0.04218362282878412,1.0,0.0,0.4834392431365463,0.26520591263706045,0.7495635151863098,0.15544041450777202,0.10751892313309845,18.22877430336519,0.04208754208754209,1.0,0.0,0.4904704013432579,0.26444124968424226,0.7901636362075806,0.14,0.27586036270071007,34.12866250888197,0.07964601769911504,0.85522030651341,0.0,0.556953460837786,0.27671986755853245,0.75347501039505,0.11678832116788322,0.08624345924290737,15.06699188528924,0.0367504835589942,1.0,0.0,0.49751652403385777,0.2761954269359779,0.7627079486846924,0.12605042016806722,0.09315052599009901,17.196123122859145,0.038461538461538464,1.0,0.0,0.5167758111216005,0.28281461795233365,0.7891920208930969,0.13333333333333333,0.15550239234449761,28.09066337877491,0.05752212389380531,0.7600933908045977,0.0,0.5711656411488851,0.2751329814439857,0.8127869367599487,0.28703703703703703,0.18206353346743248,25.282321529148504,0.16055045871559634,1.0,0.0,0.5800295649390471,0.31645903887894916,0.7751520872116089,0.1450777202072539,0.1496546962033486,20.065974579382072,0.05647840531561462,1.0,0.0,0.544324706359343,0.28400121700688946
emergency medicine,emergency medical services,Antimicrobial stewardship programs in emergency departments: how do we measure antimicrobial use? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE:
The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) has become a usual practice in hospital settings. However, the method for monitoring antimicrobial use in accident and emergency departments (ED) is not yet adequately defined. Thus, the objective of this review is to describe antimicrobial use indicators used by ASPs implemented in ED.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed based on studies found in the following academic research databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus (Period: January 2000 to December 2019). Controlled clinical trials, before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies assessing the impact of ASPs on antimicrobial use in ED were included; studies published in languages other than English or Spanish were excluded from this review.

RESULTS:
Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. In total, 15 (62.5%) studies described the ASP team members who collaborated with the ED staff. Most (21; 80.8%) studies used the percentage of patients with an antibiotic prescription as an indicator. Four (15.4%) studies included defined daily dose data. The antibiotic treatment duration was reported in four (15.4%) studies. Only two studies assessed the impact of the ASP using microbiological indicators, both of which used the incidence of infection with Clostridioides difficile as the indicator.

CONCLUSIONS:
The reports of experiences in implementing ASPs in ED show heterogeneous antimicrobial use indicators, which makes it difficult to compare results. Therefore, antimicrobial use indicators for ASPs must be standardised between hospital units.","The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) has become a usual practice in hospital settings.

","Measuring antimicrobial use in emergency departments is important to ensure that resources are managed in a safe and effective way. The impact on clinical and economic outcomes can be assessed by tracking outcomes such as shortened length of stay, decreased readmission rate, and decrease in complications related to antibiotic use. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality provides resources such as the Four Moments of Antibiotic Decision Making which aid in prescribing antibiotics. It is estimated that 50% of those antibiotics prescribed in office visits are unnecessary, increasing the risk of medication side effects and contributing to the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance. To help reduce this risk, the microbiology laboratory needs to be informed of any antimicrobial pretreatment, so other methods can be used to identify the etiologic cause.",0.7878600358963013,0.1352657004830918,0.23041885128693992,35.50425851999399,0.07604562737642585,0.8420042110804052,0.0,0.6458451544591622,0.2932235842550452,0.7759860157966614,0.125,0.22453517493836536,35.590885447333676,0.07984790874524715,0.9293451291437869,0.0,0.603471245268266,0.2795513784373428,0.757133960723877,0.10975609756097561,0.14754436567174017,23.834317918471847,0.054371002132196165,1.0,0.0,0.5330460944346019,0.2753901056394747,0.7620584964752197,0.12203389830508474,0.15739115176053176,26.297200038280483,0.061712846347607056,1.0,0.0,0.5447971347432871,0.27807388505057046,0.7450039982795715,0.06944444444444445,0.15167064439140812,27.876443580113396,0.015209125475285171,0.8237339841366687,0.0,0.5490226842636285,0.25320656122659296,0.7718363404273987,0.14521452145214522,0.15306122448979592,25.316479468524232,0.06263982102908278,1.0,0.0,0.5680847451682912,0.2848581883036387,0.7792718410491943,0.1520912547528517,0.1656196459166191,29.21014597707788,0.06722689075630252,1.0,0.0,0.5920858527789136,0.29041487877839156,0.7590500116348267,0.11920529801324503,0.21000000000000002,36.794867990093856,0.03612167300380228,0.7851994695658335,0.0,0.5856997728347778,0.2596786332563354,0.8008245825767517,0.21754385964912282,0.2640363182385654,34.3782770591173,0.12406947890818859,1.0,0.0,0.6271155441720639,0.3080057272250728,0.8010839819908142,0.23333333333333334,0.2899013125243819,41.65175800608198,0.15448504983388706,1.0,0.0,0.6190005450348579,0.30543093055818427,0.7940369844436646,0.2564102564102564,0.4347372643401525,52.747964335696615,0.11406844106463879,0.7210989932885906,0.0,0.706591625053149,0.29641847177471964,0.7931210398674011,0.15686274509803924,0.1927185234014502,34.08621407926482,0.09016393442622951,1.0,0.0,0.6216241387096612,0.29741999484375076,0.7719622254371643,0.14814814814814817,0.16071428571428573,34.431076933221355,0.07706093189964158,0.9381741524694545,0.0,0.5627839003969555,0.27316648284335737
emergency medicine,emergency medical services,Does Deprescribing Improve Quality of Life? A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Deprescribing has been shown to reduce potentially inappropriate or unnecessary medications; however, whether these benefits translate into improved quality of life (QOL) is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to isolate the impact of deprescribing on patient or designated representative reported QOL; satisfaction with care (SWC) and emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were also investigated to further explore this question.

METHODS:
This systematic review searched the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from database inception until November 2017. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized prospective studies of older adults (>â65Â years or older) and older persons with life-limiting conditions were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the search results and performed risk of bias assessments. Data on QOL, SWC, and ED visits and hospitalizations were extracted from all identified studies. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using measures recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.

RESULTS:
Screening of 6543 eligible records identified 12 studies within 13 articles. In ten studies investigating the reduction of at least one medication deprescribed, compared with usual care, all but two found no difference in QOL. To date there has only been one study examining the impact of deprescribing on SWC, which was found to be not statistically significant. Four studies exploring the impact of deprescribing on ED visits and hospitalizations also found no significant difference. However, many studies were found to have a higher performance, detection, or other bias. We found considerable heterogeneity in patient populations, targeted medications for deprescribing, and QOL measurements used in these studies.

CONCLUSION:
Based on a limited number of studies with varying methodological rigor, deprescribing may not significantly improve QOL or SWC; however, it may not contribute to additional ED visits and hospitalizations. Future controlled studies are needed.",The objective of this study was to isolate the impact of deprescribing on patient or designated representative reported QOL; satisfaction with care (SWC) and emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were also investigated to further explore this question.,"This systematic review searched the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from database inception until November 2017.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 132 papers with a large sample size of 34,143 participants found that deprescribing polypharmacy significantly decreased mortality in nonrandomized studies, but this was not statistically significant in randomized studies [4]. Another systematic review found that discontinuing benzodiazepines led to a decline in quality of life in those who continued taking the drug over 8 months compared to those who discontinued [2]. A narrative review suggested that deprescribing could potentially lead to improved quality of life, medication adherence, and reduced drug costs, but the data is inconsistent [5]. A study of 150 elderly patients found that lower medication quality was associated with lower quality of life [8]. A secondary analysis of a trial involving 372 participants found that higher polypharmacy was associated with higher symptom burden and lower quality of life [10]. However, it is important to note that the benefits and risks of deprescribing need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the process should be supervised by healthcare professionals [5,7,12,14].

TL;DR: While some evidence suggests deprescribing can improve quality of life and decrease mortality, the effects are inconsistent and vary based on factors such as the type of medication and patient population.

","Deprescribing is a necessary intervention to reduce harm from medication and improve quality of life. It is defined as reducing or discontinuing a medication, with the goal of treatment efficiency and minimal effective dosage.

emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Paediatric flexible flat foot: how are we measuring it and are we getting it right? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Flexible flat foot is a normal observation in typically developing children, however, some children with flat feet present with pain and impaired lower limb function. The challenge for health professionals is to identify when foot posture is outside of expected findings and may warrant intervention. Diagnoses of flexible flat foot is often based on radiographic or clinical measures, yet the validity and reliability of these measures for a paediatric population is not clearly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate how paediatric foot posture is defined and measured within the literature, and if the psychometric properties of these measures support any given diagnoses.

METHODS:
Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, SportDiscus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were systematically searched in January 2017 for empirical studies where participants had diagnosed flexible flat foot and were aged 18Â years or younger. Outcomes of interest were the foot posture measures and definitions used. Further articles were sought where cited in relation to the psychometric properties of the measures used.

RESULTS:
Of the 1101 unique records identified by the searches, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 20Â foot posture measures and 40 definitions of paediatric flexible flat foot. A further 18 citations were sought in relation to the psychometric properties of these measures. Three measures were deemed valid and reliable, the FPI-6â>â+â6 for children aged three to 15Â years, a Staheli arch index of >â1.07 for children aged three to six andââ¥â1.28 for children six to nine, and a Chippaux-Smirak index of >â62.7% in three to seven year olds, >â59% in six to nine year olds andââ¥â40% for children aged nine to 16Â years. No further measures were found to be valid for the paediatric population.

CONCLUSION:
No universally accepted criteria for diagnosing paediatric flat foot was found within existing literature, and psychometric data for foot posture measures and definitions used was limited. The outcomes of this review indicate that the FPI - 6, Staheli arch index or Chippaux-Smirak index should be the preferred method of paediatric foot posture measurement in future research.","Flexible flat foot is a normal observation in typically developing children, however, some children with flat feet present with pain and impaired lower limb function.

The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) and Clarke's Angle (CA) have been shown to have high intra-rater reliability and moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in determining pediatric FFF [2,3]. Radiographic measures have also been used, with some studies indicating significant improvements post-intervention [1,14]. However, one study suggested that static radiographic measures might only explain a small variance in foot kinematics during walking, particularly for flexible flatfeet [18]. Concerning interventions, foot orthoses (FOs) have been widely used, with varying evidence of their effectiveness. Some studies found that FOs may have a positive impact on outcomes such as pain, foot posture, gait, and function [13,15,17], while others found low to very low-certainty evidence regarding their effectiveness [6]. Surgical interventions, like Mosca's lateral column lengthening and subtalar arthroereisis, have shown significant improvements in radiographic measures [1,11,14]. However, these findings were based on retrospective studies with potential for selection and information bias. A standardized assessment and classification system for pediatric FFF is suggested, considering factors such as pain, age, flexibility, gender, weight, and joint hypermobility [5].

TL;DR: The existing methods for measuring pediatric flexible flatfoot vary in their accuracy and validity, and while interventions such as foot orthoses and surgery have shown some positive outcomes, the evidence is mixed and further research is needed to establish a standardized assessment and treatment approach.

The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) has shown moderate diagnostic accuracy for pediatric flexible flatfoot [9]. Some studies suggest that foot orthoses (FOs) may have a positive impact on outcomes such as pain, foot posture, and function, although the evidence is unclear due to methodological limitations and lack of uniformity [2,3,7,8]. In particular, the use of high-cost customised FOs (CFOs) for healthy children with flexible flat feet lacks supporting evidence [7,8]. Other interventions like corrective exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation have shown positive results [10]. However, the quality of existing studies is generally poor, limiting the ability to draw definitive conclusions [2]. Future research should focus on developing consensus recommendations for measuring the pediatric foot using valid and reliable assessment tools [11].

Physical examination involves observing the child's foot both in a non-weight bearing and weight bearing state. Gait analysis allows for the observation of any abnormalities in the child's walking pattern. Imaging techniques provide a detailed view of the foot's structure.

However, there is ongoing debate in the medical community about the accuracy and effectiveness of these measurement methods. Some studies suggest that physical examination and gait analysis can be subjective and may not always accurately diagnose the condition. Imaging techniques, while providing a detailed view of the foot's structure, may not always correlate with the functional impact of the condition. Therefore, while these methods are commonly used, there is still a need for more standardized and objective measurement tools in diagnosing paediatric flexible flat foot.""","Flexible flat foot is a common condition in pediatric patients. It is typically diagnosed based on clinical examination and measurement of certain parameters. The most commonly used method to measure pediatric flexible flat foot is the arch index, which is calculated by dividing the footprint width by the footprint length. Other measurements that may be used include the Chippaux-Smirak index and the Staheli arch index. However, it is important to note that there is no consensus on the most accurate measurement method for pediatric flexible flat foot. Different studies have used different measurement techniques, leading to variations in prevalence rates and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, it is still an ongoing debate whether we are accurately measuring pediatric flexible flat foot.

Evans 2011 suggests that most flexible flat feet are asymptomatic and require no treatment, but when treatment is necessary, it should be directed algorithmically according to pain, age, and flexibility. Halabchi 2013 recommends an algorithmic approach to pediatric flatfoot diagnosis and management, which includes activity modification, proper shoe and orthoses, exercises, medication, and surgery as a last resort. Benedetti 2011 suggests that a systematic clinical approach to assess children with flexible flatfoot should always be recommended for the correct diagnosis and the associated treatment management based on symptoms, functional limitation, and foot dysfunction."," The diagnosis and treatment of pediatric flexible flatfoot is a complex issue with multiple methods of measurement and intervention.

The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) and Clarke's Angle (CA) have been shown to have high intra-rater reliability and moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in determining pediatric FFF [2,3]. Radiographic measures have also been used, with some studies indicating significant improvements post-intervention [1,14]. However, one study suggested that static radiographic measures might only explain a small variance in foot kinematics during walking, particularly for flexible flatfeet [18]. Concerning interventions, foot orthoses (FOs) have been widely used, with varying evidence of their effectiveness. Some studies found that FOs may have a positive impact on outcomes such as pain, foot posture, gait, and function [13,15,17], while others found low to very low-certainty evidence regarding their effectiveness [6]. Surgical interventions, like Mosca's lateral column lengthening and subtalar arthroereisis, have shown significant improvements in radiographic measures [1,11,14]. However, these findings were based on retrospective studies with potential for selection and information bias. A standardized assessment and classification system for pediatric FFF is suggested, considering factors such as pain, age, flexibility, gender, weight, and joint hypermobility [5].

"," The existing methods for measuring pediatric flexible flatfoot vary in their accuracy and validity, and while interventions such as foot orthoses and surgery have shown some positive outcomes, the evidence is mixed and further research is needed to establish a standardized assessment and treatment approach.

"," The assessment and management of pediatric flexible flat foot is a topic of ongoing debate, with no universally accepted diagnostic criteria or treatment approach [1,2,5,6]. Various methods are utilized to diagnose flat foot, including footprint measures, radiographic measures, and visual observations, but no standardized framework exists [6,9,13]. The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) has shown moderate diagnostic accuracy for pediatric flexible flatfoot [9]. Some studies suggest that foot orthoses (FOs) may have a positive impact on outcomes such as pain, foot posture, and function, although the evidence is unclear due to methodological limitations and lack of uniformity [2,3,7,8]. In particular, the use of high-cost customised FOs (CFOs) for healthy children with flexible flat feet lacks supporting evidence [7,8]. Other interventions like corrective exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation have shown positive results [10]. However, the quality of existing studies is generally poor, limiting the ability to draw definitive conclusions [2]. Future research should focus on developing consensus recommendations for measuring the pediatric foot using valid and reliable assessment tools [11].

"," There is currently no standardized method for diagnosing pediatric flexible flat foot, and the efficacy of treatments such as foot orthoses is still uncertain due to the generally poor quality of existing studies. More research is needed to develop standardized diagnostic criteria and evaluate treatment approaches.

","The gold standard for the evaluation of paediatric flexible flatfoot is weight-bearing radiographs that assess the degree of arch collapse, particularly by measuring the lateral first tarsometatarsal angle, and forefoot abduction at the talonavicular joint. Other evaluations, such as developmental history, past medical history, past surgical history, family history, activity level, etc. should be taken into consideration. A recent study found that all surgical treatments, such as medial calcaneal osteotomies, lateral column lengthening, and double or triple arthrodesis, could result in significant improvement for the patient. Most children who suffer from this condition are asymptomatic, but the minority few with rigid, symptomatic flat feet need to be assessed as early as possible for a successful intervention.",0.7646632194519043,0.08695652173913042,0.06333830104321908,12.12286050652916,0.02249134948096886,1.0,0.0,0.496154066126842,0.2672264695601509,0.7747618556022644,0.08791208791208792,0.06003958599234206,10.814147433959603,0.022658610271903322,1.0,0.0,0.49062013226686063,0.27554146466743157,0.7133184671401978,0.04672897196261682,0.028646981048920227,8.325087628332831,0.010101010101010102,1.0,0.0,0.39910545270808423,0.23362360048815844,0.7132341861724854,0.043715846994535526,0.03326509723643808,9.553080444685696,0.011764705882352941,1.0,0.0,0.3995213361480568,0.2334809282391459,0.7741992473602295,0.07272727272727274,0.09771986970684039,28.81356030400352,0.03389830508474576,0.8768996960486323,0.0,0.5257907081395388,0.25746548871940217,0.7366064786911011,0.050909090909090904,0.028237951807228913,7.122877059029234,0.012998266897746967,1.0,0.0,0.42815403191954493,0.24975277610979024,0.7312819957733154,0.061403508771929835,0.03837023840614856,8.259982295391262,0.014799154334038054,1.0,0.0,0.42926165888740747,0.24842422897342256,0.8184576034545898,0.11267605633802817,0.11956521739130435,25.549814982989627,0.043010752688172046,1.0,0.0,0.5726754530972126,0.2957469498875345,0.7636860013008118,0.08661417322834646,0.0580836127409891,9.639464574323556,0.02015355086372361,1.0,0.0,0.46876738520411704,0.276628894589386,0.7655395269393921,0.10679611650485436,0.05985463593504453,11.547099743644434,0.02289156626506024,1.0,0.0,0.4682055635452271,0.2773225758403528,0.8411735892295837,0.2222222222222222,0.1818289504856669,27.214201325318538,0.07368421052631578,1.0,0.0,0.6271271458211934,0.32683269260790354,0.8117910027503967,0.17297297297297298,0.0842670993256604,14.352105197506065,0.053824362606232294,1.0,0.0,0.5142021280414654,0.30147373192396454,0.7660308480262756,0.06993006993006994,0.04827031375703942,11.988203103393165,0.018726591760299626,1.0,0.0,0.47167225173079824,0.26384306166335997
emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Can statistic adjustment of OR minimize the potential confounding bias for meta-analysis of case-control study? A secondary data analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Different confounder adjustment strategies were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) in case-control study, i.e. how many confounders original studies adjusted and what the variables are. This secondary data analysis is aimed to detect whether there are potential biases caused by difference of confounding factor adjustment strategies in case-control study, and whether such bias would impact the summary effect size of meta-analysis.

METHODS:
We included all meta-analyses that focused on the association between breast cancer and passive smoking among non-smoking women, as well as each original case-control studies included in these meta-analyses. The relative deviations (RDs) of each original study were calculated to detect how magnitude the adjustment would impact the estimation of ORs, compared with crude ORs. At the same time, a scatter diagram was sketched to describe the distribution of adjusted ORs with different number of adjusted confounders.

RESULTS:
Substantial inconsistency existed in meta-analysis of case-control studies, which would influence the precision of the summary effect size. First, mixed unadjusted and adjusted ORs were used to combine individual OR in majority of meta-analysis. Second, original studies with different adjustment strategies of confounders were combined, i.e. the number of adjusted confounders and different factors being adjusted in each original study. Third, adjustment did not make the effect size of original studies trend to constringency, which suggested that model fitting might have failed to correct the systematic error caused by confounding.

CONCLUSIONS:
The heterogeneity of confounder adjustment strategies in case-control studies may lead to further bias for summary effect size in meta-analyses, especially for weak or medium associations so that the direction of causal inference would be even reversed. Therefore, further methodological researches are needed, referring to the assessment of confounder adjustment strategies, as well as how to take this kind of bias into consideration when drawing conclusion based on summary estimation of meta-analyses.","Different confounder adjustment strategies were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) in case-control study, i.e. how many confounders original studies adjusted and what the variables are.

In a study on the association between H. pylori infection and Parkinson's disease, adjusted studies showed an increased risk of Parkinson's disease [1]. Similarly, a systematic review on the association between particulate air pollution and birth outcomes found that the effect size of the association between PM exposure and birth weight was stronger after adjustment for maternal smoking [2]. In a meta-analysis of the association between delirium in elderly patients and long-term poor outcomes, high-quality studies with statistical control for important confounders were included, further supporting the utility of adjusting for confounders [4]. Another study on the association between sarcopenia and dysphagia also noted that after adjusting for confounders, the association remained significant [5].

Confounding bias occurs when the association between an exposure and outcome is distorted by the presence of a third variable.

This adjustment helps to provide a more accurate estimate of the true association between the exposure and outcome in the meta-analysis.","The papers collectively suggest that adjusting for confounding variables in case-control studies can be challenging and may introduce bias into meta-analyses.

Lubin 1984 evaluated the bias in estimation of relative risk associated with different restrictions on controls in case-control analyses of cohort studies. Etikan 2016 discussed the challenges of using both cohort and case-control studies in meta-analyses, particularly in situations where meaningful prevalences or incidences are not available. Finally, Stone 2019 compared different methods for bias adjustment in meta-analyses and found that quality effects modelling may have fewer limitations than other approaches.

","The use of statistical adjustment of the odds ratio (OR) can be employed to minimize the potential confounding bias for meta-analysis of case-control studies. The OR is the odds of having a disease (or outcome) when exposed to a given factor, versus the odds of having the disease when not exposed. To calculate OR, a 2×2 table can be used to compare the exposed and unexposed groups. To reduce the risk of admission bias, the researcher can select appropriate controls, or employ different methods of statistical analysis to account for potential confounding variables.

emergency medicine,pediatric trauma,Are hypothalamic- pituitary (HP) axis deficiencies after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of relevance for adult cancer patients? - a systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Cranial radiotherapy (cRT) can induce hormonal deficiencies as a consequence of significant doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis. In contrast to profound endocrinological follow-up data from survivors of childhood cancer treated with cRT, little knowledge exists for adult cancer patients.

METHODS:
A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database and the Cochrane library offering the basis for our debate of the relevance of HP axis impairment after cRT in adult cancer patients. Against the background of potential relevance for patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), a particular focus was set on the temporal onset of hypopituitarism and the radiation dose to the HP axis.

RESULTS:
Twenty-eight original papers with a total of 1728 patients met the inclusion criteria. Radiation doses to the HP area ranged from 4 to 97 Gray (Gy). Hypopituitarism incidences ranged from 20 to 93% for adult patients with nasopharyngeal cancer or non-pituitary brain tumors. No study focused particularly on hypopituitarism after WBRT. The onset of hypopituitarism occurred as early as within the first year following cRT (range: 3âmonths to 25.6âyears). However, since most studies started follow-up evaluation only several years after cRT, early onset of hypopituitarism might have gone unnoticed.

CONCLUSION:
Hypopituitarism occurs frequently after cRT in adult cancer patients. Despite the general conception that it develops only after several years, onset of endocrine sequelae can occur within the first year after cRT without a clear threshold. This finding is worth debating particularly in respect of treatment options for patients with brain metastases and favorable survival prognoses.","Cranial radiotherapy (cRT) can induce hormonal deficiencies as a consequence of significant doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis.

","Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a treatment used to reduce tumor size, however, radiation doses in the range of 40 to 70 Gy may damage the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis and lead to pituitary damage and resultant hypopituitarism. Long-term monitoring of hormone levels is recommended for patients who receive radiation to the head and neck region.

emergency medicine,pediatric trauma,Is percutaneous pinning needed for the treatment of displaced distal radius metaphyseal fractures in children?: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Distal radius metaphyseal (DRM) fractures are very frequent childhood fractures. Whether additional percutaneous pinning improves the outcome remains controversial. In this review, we tried to systematically evaluate the effect of percutaneous pinning on re-displacement, secondary reduction, radiographs, function, and complications in children with displaced DRM fractures.

METHODS:
PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were explored systematically to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) comparing cast immobilization alone or following reduction to additional percutaneous pinning in the treatment of pediatric displaced DRM fractures. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles and extracted relevant information from each article. The methodological quality of eligible articles was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk assessment tool (RCTs) and modified Jadad scale (CCTs).

RESULTS:
A total of 4 RCTs and 3 CCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total patient count of 1144 children. The results showed that additional percutaneous pinning significantly reduced the rate of re-placement (Chi-square tests, Pâ<â.001) and complications (Chi-square tests, Pâ=â.030). The superior results, both radiographically and functionally seemed to be temporary. No difference was found between the 2 groups after longer-term follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review suggested that compared with casting following reduction, percutaneous pinning had a positive effect on maintaining the initial reduction and reducing fracture complication rate of displaced DRM fractures in children, but with no significant improvement in function and radiographic outcome at the long-term follow-up. We suggest clinicians think twice before percutaneous pinning of displaced pediatric DRM fractures.","Distal radius metaphyseal (DRM) fractures are very frequent childhood fractures.

Retrospective studies have shown that percutaneous pinning can result in good healing and function with low complication rates [1,3,11,12]. The Kapandji technique, which involves closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for these fractures [3]. The use of intrafocal pinning has been proposed as an alternative to conventional pinning [12]. A randomized controlled trial found that percutaneous pinning with Kirschner wires reduced re-displacement and improved pronation and supination, but also had more complications [10]. Another prospective randomized study found that percutaneous pin fixation had a lower rate of subsequent loss of reduction requiring remanipulation compared to cast immobilization, but had a higher rate of pin-related complications [13]. However, several studies have suggested that conservative treatment can result in satisfactory outcomes, with deformities fully correcting in children up to certain ages [7,8,9]. A retrospective cohort study found that re-manipulation did not improve outcomes in children under 12 years old [6].

TL;DR: The necessity of percutaneous pinning for displaced distal radius metaphyseal fractures in children is uncertain, with some studies suggesting benefits in preventing re-displacement, while others indicate that conservative treatment can also yield satisfactory outcomes. The choice of treatment may depend on factors such as the child's age and the specific characteristics of the fracture.

Percutaneous pinning involves the insertion of pins through the skin and into the bone to stabilize the fracture and promote proper healing. This procedure is commonly used when the fracture is displaced, meaning the bone fragments are not aligned properly. By using percutaneous pinning, the bones can be realigned and held in place, allowing for proper healing and reducing the risk of complications. However, the decision to perform percutaneous pinning will depend on various factors, including the severity of the fracture, the age of the child, and the presence of any associated injuries. It is important for a healthcare professional to evaluate each case individually and determine the most appropriate treatment approach.","The papers are divided on whether percutaneous pinning is needed for the treatment of displaced distal radius metaphyseal fractures in children. Zeng 2018 conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials and found that percutaneous pinning had a positive effect on maintaining the initial reduction and reducing fracture complication rate of displaced DRM fractures in children, but with no significant improvement in function and radiographic outcome at the long-term follow-up. However, Yung 2004 and Choi 1995 both found that percutaneous pinning was a safe and effective procedure for treating forearm fractures in children, with no deleterious effects on subsequent growth of the distal radius. Miller 2005 conducted a prospective randomized study and found that patients treated with pin fixation had no cases of loss of reduction, while 39% of patients treated with casting had subsequent loss of reduction requiring remanipulation. However, 38% of patients treated with pin fixation had pin-related complications.

","For displaced distal radius metaphyseal fractures in children, percutaneous pinning (CRPP) may be needed for necessary treatment. There is ongoing debate about acceptable limits of angulation, malrotation, and bayonet apposition in pediatric patients with DR fractures. However, non-displaced fractures with less than 50% of displacement can usually be treated non-operatively.

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Is metformin use associated with low mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19? a multivariable and propensity score-adjusted meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic that the entire world is facing since December of 2019. Increasing evidence has shown that metformin is linked to favorable outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to address whether outpatient or inpatient metformin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with low in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

METHODS:
We searched studies published in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library up to November 1, 2022. Raw event data extracted from individual study were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel approach. Odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for covariates that potentially confound the association using multivariable regression or propensity score matching was pooled by the inverse-variance method. Random effect models were applied for meta-analysis due to variance among studies.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two retrospective observational studies were selected. The pooled unadjusted OR for outpatient metformin therapy and in-hospital mortality was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.37-0.62) and the pooled OR adjusted with multivariable regression or propensity score matching was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.50-0.99). The pooled unadjusted OR for inpatient metformin therapy and in-hospital mortality was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.10-0.31), whereas the pooled adjusted HR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.38-3.15).

Results suggest that there is a significant association between the reduction of in-hospital mortality and outpatient metformin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients hospitalized for COVID-19."," The association between metformin use and COVID-19 mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been investigated in several studies.

Similarly, a retrospective cohort study of 16,504 individuals also found that metformin use was associated with lower odds of severe outcomes [18]. Another retrospective study of 1356 patients found that metformin use prior to hospitalization was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality [6]. However, other studies have shown mixed results. For instance, a retrospective study of 1,213 individuals found no association between metformin use and 28-day COVID-19-related mortality [1], and another study of 4,462 patients found no significant differences in in-hospital mortality between metformin users and non-users [10]. A cross-sectional study of 355 patients found that metformin use was associated with lower mortality [22], while a retrospective study of 328 patients found no significant association between metformin use and 30-day all-cause mortality [9].

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,"After Dinner Rest a While, After Supper Walk a Mile? A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis on the Acute Postprandial Glycemic Response to Exercise Before and After Meal Ingestion in Healthy Subjects and Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance.","BACKGROUND:
The most effective way to cope with high blood sugar spikes is to engage in physical activity in temporal proximity to food intake. However, so far, it is unclear as to whether there is an optimal time for physical activity around food intake.

OBJECTIVES:
We aimed to identify the impact of pre- and post-meal exercise on postprandial glucose excursions in humans with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022324070. We screened MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane/CINAHL/EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge until 1 May, 2022. We used the risk of bias rating with the crossover extension of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool II. Standardized mean differences (SMDs, Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as pooled effect estimates of a random-effects meta-analysis. Eligibility criteria included three-armed randomized controlled trials comparing the acute effects of pre- and post-meal exercise to a no-exercise control in humans.

RESULTS:
Eight randomized controlled trials (crossover trials, high risk of bias) with 30 interventions in 116 participants (47 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 69 without type 2 diabetes) were eligible. Exercise after meal ingestion (real food or meal replacement drinks) led to a reduction in postprandial glucose excursions compared with exercise before eating (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=â0.47 [95% CI 0.23, 0.70]) and an inactive control condition (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=â0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.75]. Pre-meal exercise did not lead to significantly lower postprandial glucose compared to an inactive control (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=ââ-â0.13 [95% CIâ-â0.42, 0.17]). The time between meal and exercise (estimateâ=ââ-â0.0151; standard errorâ=â0.00473; Zâ=ââ-â3.19; pâ=â0.001; 95% CIâ-â0.024,â-â0.006) had a moderating influence on postprandial glucose excursions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Exercise, i.e., walking, has a greater acute beneficial impact on postprandial hyperglycemia when undertaken as soon as possible after a meal rather than after a longer interval or before eating.

A review of 20 studies found that post-meal exercise had a beneficial impact on postprandial glycemia, but there was insufficient evidence to determine if the timing of exercise in relation to meals had an effect on postprandial glycemic response [3]. An interventional study on overweight women found no significant effect of the timing of exercise (morning vs afternoon) on appetite, energy intake, or perceived exertion [4]. Reviews on the impact of circadian rhythms suggest that the timing of nutrition and exercise could potentially support circadian rhythm and prevent metabolic diseases [5][7]. However, these reviews also acknowledge challenges in aligning biological and social time [5] and the influence of the circadian clock on the timing of physical activity and food intake [7]. A theoretical discussion suggests that intermittent metabolic switching, such as fasting and exercise followed by recovery periods of eating, resting, and sleeping, may optimize brain function and resilience [6].

","The research indicates that performing short intervals of physical activity throughout the day is superior to sustained, moderate to vigorous activity in order to promote weight and fat loss, improve cardiometabolic parameters, and maintain weight. From this, it is recommended that individuals should accumulate a minimum of 150-300 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75-150 minutes of vigorous physical activity weekly. For those wishing to lose weight, 200-300 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week is recommended. The effect of increased physical activity late in the day remains unclear. Ultimately, this physical activity combined with a healthy, balanced eating plan will be beneficial for weight loss in both the short and long-term. As for the question of whether there is an optimal time for physical activity around food intake, the evidence is inconclusive.",0.7589165568351746,0.12435233160621761,0.15857284440039646,32.93310905228214,0.07777777777777778,0.8424039780521262,0.0,0.5525620145457132,0.26082911590275176,0.7498031258583069,0.1333333333333333,0.16816143497757846,31.894380742065692,0.06888888888888889,0.7816001899335232,0.0,0.5198635411889929,0.2502711417980972,0.7865608334541321,0.12337662337662336,0.11650730635284944,25.92949461213968,0.05757575757575758,1.0,0.0,0.5607924895328388,0.28979921716869084,0.7883898019790649,0.12592592592592594,0.11898466419883658,28.973130164572865,0.06743002544529263,1.0,0.0,0.562852237754398,0.2885233069309829,0.7989223003387451,0.11678832116788321,0.20977443609022556,33.96868139892439,0.04666666666666667,0.8087371046845933,0.0,0.6294486804441972,0.291764724735876,0.7793665528297424,0.12012012012012013,0.13249198328907819,22.55638671658393,0.05394990366088632,1.0,0.0,0.53401209597002,0.28584978142425854,0.7827011942863464,0.12186379928315413,0.11991657977059438,25.526943908874177,0.06265664160401002,1.0,0.0,0.5464437726181224,0.28689848140276586,0.7650030255317688,0.1176470588235294,0.20281975921157294,34.69449047967384,0.04,0.815679947624392,0.0,0.5417494759673164,0.26587572123500597,0.7817084193229675,0.11764705882352942,0.1229497579269822,23.91125019050962,0.05533199195171026,1.0,0.0,0.5395633825775591,0.28505990867918196,0.7836043238639832,0.11895910780669144,0.13354109116022098,27.81417007756587,0.06133333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.5546230110704624,0.2872831858140831,0.7697165012359619,0.1045751633986928,0.22082857218782387,35.28444087329674,0.04666666666666667,0.7497251818028073,0.0,0.547834355323041,0.2657968141201371,0.7495060563087463,0.0849056603773585,0.09820666097352691,27.38501897359204,0.04935622317596566,0.926304379776602,0.0,0.5159904086782087,0.25092504222307915,0.7420758605003357,0.07438016528925619,0.09877384196185288,23.946276610058874,0.04340836012861737,1.0,0.0,0.49691137289855536,0.24777349854407985
endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Is non-high-density lipoprotein associated with metabolic syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) which is calculated by subtracting the HDL-C value from the total cholesterol level, atherogenic index (ratio between triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C concentrations (TG/HDL-C)), and Diff-C (calculated by subtracting low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) from non-HDL-C), have been known as valuable predictors of dyslipidemia and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have reported the potential association of novel atherogenic lipid indices with metabolic syndrome (MetS). This meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled association of novel atherogenic lipid indices with MetS or its components.

METHODS:
A systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases from January 2000 until March 2021 to evaluate the association of novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-HDL-C, atherogenic index, and the difference between non-HDL-C and LDL-C (Diff-C) with MetS. Observational studies were included without any language restriction. As exclusive studies evaluating the association of non-HDL-C with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were eligible to be included in quantitative analyses, a random-effect meta-analysis was performed to pool the odds ratios (ORs). A stratified meta-analysis was performed based on the definition of MetS [Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF)] and the studied population.

RESULTS:
Overall, 318 studies were retrieved from an initial systematic search. After screening, 18 and five studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses, respectively. Qualitative synthesis revealed an association between non-HDL-C, Diff-C, and atherogenic index with MetS and its components. Stratified meta-analysis showed that an increased non-HDL-C level was associated with an increased odds of MetS based on ATP criteria (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 2.14-5.39) and IDF criteria (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.98-3.44) in adults (OR: 3.53, 95% CI: 2.29-4.78) and in children (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.65-2.90).

CONCLUSION:
Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including atherogenic index, Diff-c, and non-HDL-C, are strongly associated with increased odds of MetS and its components. The indices could be considered as potential predictors of MetS and its components in clinical practice.","Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) which is calculated by subtracting the HDL-C value from the total cholesterol level, atherogenic index (ratio between triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C concentrations (TG/HDL-C)), and Diff-C (calculated by subtracting low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) from non-HDL-C), have been known as valuable predictors of dyslipidemia and subsequent cardiovascular diseases.

","Yes, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is associated with metabolic syndrome. Hyperlipidemia, one of the contributing factors to the condition, may lead to an increased risk of atherosclerosis if not properly managed. Lipoprotein-X, a type of lipoprotein anomaly, can lead to false LDL levels in patients with liver dysfunction, LCAT deficiency, lipid infusion, or graft vs. host disease in liver transplant patients. VLDL (low-density lipoprotein) can cause insulin resistance which can lead to hyperlipidemia. VLDL can also induce macrophage apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species production and cause a pro-inflammatory state. Additionally, VLDL can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue, heightening the risk of coronary artery disease.

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Human amniotic membrane products for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. do they help? a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most serious diabetic complications. DFU is an open wound that usually occurs in the foot sole due to poor blood glucose control, peripheral neuropathy, and poor circulation. The human amniotic allograft membrane is a biological wound dressing derived from the amniotic membrane. It contains amino acids, nutrients, cytokines, and growth factors that make the growth process easier.

OBJECTIVE:
To compare dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (DHACA) plus the standard of wound care (SOC) with the SOC alone.

METHODS:
We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science till April 2021 using relevant keywords. All search results were screened for eligibility. We extracted the data from the included trials and pooled them as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager software (ver. 5.4).

RESULTS:
The pooled effect estimate from 11 RCTs showed that DHACA was superior to SOC regarding the complete wound healing in both 6th and 12th week (RRâ=â3.78; 95% CI: [2.51, 5.70]; Pâ<â0.00001) and (RRâ=â2.00; 95% CI: [1.67, 2.39], Pâ<â0.00001 respectively). Also, the analysis favored the DHACA regarding the mean time to heal in the 12th-week (MDâ=â-12.07, 95%CI: [-19.23, -4.91], Pâ=â0.001). The wound size reduction was better with DHACA (MDâ=â1.18, 95%CI: [-0,10, 2.26], Pâ=â0.03).

CONCLUSION:
Using DHACA with SOC is safer and more effective than using SOC alone for DFU patients.",To compare dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (DHACA) plus the standard of wound care (SOC) with the SOC alone.,"We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science till April 2021 using relevant keywords.

Clinical trials and case series have shown that both cryopreserved and dehydrated amniotic membrane (AM) products can enhance wound healing when combined with standard therapy [2][3][5]. A randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial with 110 patients demonstrated significantly higher rates of complete healing with dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (dHACM) compared to standard care [8]. A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials also found that amniotic membrane products significantly improved healing rates compared to the control group [13]. However, there is variability in the healing rate reported in different studies, and the optimal preparation and frequency of application are still under debate [4][6]. Furthermore, the risk of bias in many of these studies is not clear, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness [2][3][5][6][8][13].

endocrinology,bone disorders,"Are the Pathologic Features of Enthesopathy, Tendinopathy, and Labral and Articular Disc Disease Related to Mucoid Degeneration? A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND:
Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, labral degeneration, and pathologic conditions of the articular disc (knee meniscus and ulnocarpal) are sometimes described in terms of inflammation or damage, while the histopathologic findings are often consistent with mucoid degeneration. A systematic review of the histopathology of these structures at diverse locations might reconceptualize these diseases as expected aspects of human aging. The potential benefits of this evolution might include healthier patient and clinician mindsets as well as a reduced likelihood of overdiagnosis and overtreatment resulting from greater awareness of base rates of pathology.

QUESTION/PURPOSE:
In this systematic review of studies of surgical specimens, we asked: Are there are any differences in the histopathologic findings of structural soft tissue conditions (mucoid degeneration, inflammation, and vascularity) by anatomic site (foot, elbow, or knee) or structure (tendon body, muscle or tendon origin or insertion [enthesis], labrum, or articular disc)?

METHODS:
Studies between 1980 and 2021 investigating the histopathologic findings of specimens from surgery for trigger digit, de Quervain tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, lateral and medial elbow enthesopathy, rotator cuff tendinopathy, posterior tibial tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles tendinopathy, or disease of the hip labrum, ulnocarpal articular disc, or knee meniscus were searched for in the PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Inclusion criteria were the prespecified anatomic location or structure being analyzed histologically and any findings described with respect to inflammation, vascularity, or mucoid degeneration. Studies were excluded if they were nonhuman studies or review articles. Search terms included ""anatomy,"" ""pathology,"" and ""histopathology."" These terms were coupled with anatomic structures or disorders and included ""trigger finger,"" ""de Quervain,"" ""fasciitis, plantar,"" ""tennis elbow,"" ""rotator cuff tendinopathy,"" ""elbow tendinopathy,"" ""patellar tendonitis,"" ""posterior tibial tendon,"" and ""triangular fibrocartilage."" This resulted in 3196 studies. After applying the inclusion criteria, 559 articles were then assessed for eligibility according to our exclusion criteria, with 52 eventually included. We recorded whether the study identified the following histopathologic findings: inflammatory cells or molecular markers, greater than expected vascularity (categorized as quantitative count, with or without controls; molecular markers; or qualitative judgments), and features of mucoid degeneration (disorganized collagen, increased extracellular matrix, or chondroid metaplasia). In the absence of methods for systematically evaluating the pathophysiology of structural (collagenous) soft tissue structures and rating histopathologic study quality, all studies that interpreted histopathology results were included. The original authors' judgment regarding the presence or absence of inflammation, greater than expected vascularity, and elements of mucoid degeneration was recorded along with the type of data used to reach that conclusion.

RESULTS:
Regarding differences in the histopathology of surgical specimens of structural soft tissue conditions by anatomic site, there were no differences in inflammation or mucoid degeneration, and the knee meniscus was less often described as having greater than normal vascularity. There were no differences by anatomic structure. Overall, 20% (10 of 51) of the studies that investigated for inflammation reported it (nine inflammatory cells and one inflammatory marker). Eighty-three percent (43 of 52) interpreted increased vascularity: 40% (17 of 43) using quantitative methods (14 with controls and three without) and 60% (26 of 43) using imprecise criteria. Additionally, 100% (all 52 studies) identified at least one element of mucoid degeneration: 69% (36 of 52) reported an increased extracellular matrix, 71% (37 of 52) reported disorganized collagen, and 33% (17 of 52) reported chondroid metaplasia.

CONCLUSION:
Our systematic review of the histopathology of diseases of soft tissue structures (enthesopathy, tendinopathy, and labral and articular disc) identified consistent mucoid degeneration, minimal inflammation, and imprecise assessment of relative vascularity; these findings were consistent across anatomic sites and structures, supporting a reconceptualization of these diseases as related to aging (senescence or degeneration) rather than injury or activity.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
This reconceptualization supports accommodative mindsets known to be associated with greater comfort and capability. In addition, awareness of the notable base rates of structural soft tissue changes as people age might reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment of incidental, benign, or inconsequential signal changes and pathophysiology.","Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, labral degeneration, and pathologic conditions of the articular disc (knee meniscus and ulnocarpal) are sometimes described in terms of inflammation or damage, while the histopathologic findings are often consistent with mucoid degeneration.

"," Several studies provide evidence on the relationship between the pathologic features of enthesopathy, tendinopathy, labral and articular disc disease, and mucoid degeneration. A study examining surgical procedures in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy found that those who had Achilles debridement for mucoid degeneration had longer return-to-activity times compared to other procedures [4]. Another study involving surgical procedures in track athletes/runners with chronic Achilles tendinopathy reported a longer return-to-activity time in patients who had Achilles debridement for mucoid degeneration [10]. A case report of a sedentary woman with chronic knee pain and an extensive ganglion of the patellar tendon suggested that mucoid degeneration in connective tissue could be due to chronic repetitive microtraumas [6]. A study investigating the association between histologic findings of tendon degeneration and increased MRI signal found that increased mucoid degeneration correlated with increased MRI signal intensity [8]. Another study found that abnormal collagen fiber arrangements, fragmentation of fibrils, inflammatory cell infiltration, newly formed vessels, mucoid degeneration, meniscal tears, and the presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts were present in joint disc specimens during the progression of internal derangement in the temporomandibular joint [9]. Finally, a study found a significant positive relationship between trochlear dysplasia and mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament [11].

These conditions have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Enthesopathy refers to the inflammation or degeneration of the enthesis, which is the site where a tendon or ligament attaches to the bone. Tendinopathy is a condition characterized by tendon degeneration and can be caused by repetitive overuse, trauma, or aging. Labral and articular disc disease involve the degeneration or injury to the labrum or articular disc, respectively, which are structures that provide stability and cushioning in joints. Mucoid degeneration, on the other hand, refers to the accumulation of mucoid material within tissues and is typically seen in conditions such as ganglion cysts or myxoid tumors. While these conditions may coexist in some cases, they are not directly related in terms of their pathologic features.","The papers provide some insights into the relationship between mucoid degeneration and pathologic features of enthesopathy, tendinopathy, and labral and articular disc disease. Bruni 2022 conducted a systematic review of the histopathology of these soft tissue conditions and found consistent mucoid degeneration across anatomic sites and structures, supporting a reconceptualization of these diseases as related to aging rather than injury or activity. Lotz 2006 suggests that pathologic disc degeneration is characterized by ineffective injury-healing of peripheral tissue, with the end plate and peripheral part of the anulus being the likely sites for focal damage, inflammation, neoinnervation, and nociceptor sensitization. Resnick 1983 describes enthesopathy as a disease process occurring at sites of tendon and ligament attachment to bone, with specific radiographic features allowing for a precise diagnosis. Benjamin 2001 proposes that inflammatory responses characteristic of spondyloarthropathies are triggered at seemingly diverse sites, including entheses, in genetically susceptible individuals due to a combination of anatomical factors leading to higher levels of tissue microtrauma and the deposition of microbes. Overall, the papers suggest that mucoid degeneration may be related to pathologic features of these soft tissue conditions, but further research is needed to fully understand the relationship."," Several studies provide evidence on the relationship between the pathologic features of enthesopathy, tendinopathy, labral and articular disc disease, and mucoid degeneration.

","The pathologic features of enthesopathy, tendinopathy, and labral and articular disc disease can be related to the mucoid degeneration process. The degenerative changes begin with the breakdown of the cartilage, followed by joint space narrowing, sclerosing of the bone, and formation of erosions. Histological studies can reveal ghost chondrocytes, subchondral cysts, fragmented and irregular cartilage, and reactive new bone formation. Mechanical stress and inflammation both contribute to enthesopathy, with chemokines such as CXCL1, CCL2, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 contributing to the inflammatory response. GAGs in the articular cartilage, extracellular matrix, and tendons initiate an inflammatory cascade leading to osetoarthritis with deformities such as the claw hand and decreased mobility. NSAIDs can inhibit inflammatory mediators, preventing the associated degenerative joint changes.",0.7679464817047119,0.17575757575757578,0.22526421044500794,45.303772931329725,0.09447983014861996,0.7023230490018149,0.0,0.6125221728708186,0.276168480445432,0.764513373374939,0.11347517730496455,0.27802276532565207,41.47589304989586,0.07112526539278131,0.834832583708146,0.0,0.6053092655013589,0.27186004406473074,0.7784706950187683,0.1506849315068493,0.17433867000928227,36.41119577961878,0.09147424511545293,1.0,0.0,0.6145177521940434,0.2954463780320297,0.7820698022842407,0.1561712846347607,0.17465533569080052,39.226947820486906,0.09554140127388536,0.896271212219977,0.0,0.6206582053871212,0.2971184702696583,0.7771046757698059,0.1415929203539823,0.24465384615384617,33.647778611191406,0.044585987261146494,0.8597901049475263,0.0,0.6747026464395356,0.2768674544182694,0.781126856803894,0.13526570048309178,0.16435971706725755,37.98163677714192,0.09642147117296222,0.9911285834355549,0.0,0.6265611671868649,0.30045632741211836,0.7791637778282166,0.13720316622691292,0.15928047597462464,38.42431475811584,0.06157112526539278,0.9372563718140929,0.0,0.6292842866000482,0.2955777154381634,0.7705989480018616,0.11818181818181818,0.2529564860052053,32.867469767554816,0.045647558386411886,0.8523238380809596,0.0,0.6409729205328842,0.27537824379964637,0.8210604786872864,0.2172523961661342,0.3607336590513536,55.80983202728935,0.1602972399150743,0.8071316558469535,0.0,0.7067005895651304,0.3269196313368422,0.8248536586761475,0.19718309859154928,0.3888470597171733,55.042429573932516,0.11889596602972399,0.7641943888195762,0.0,0.7171466669274701,0.3281657978268525,0.7889824509620667,0.1588785046728972,0.30864419475655436,34.773355548605856,0.06050955414012739,0.8828495588271439,0.0,0.7466892055843187,0.28711867319309664,0.8018741011619568,0.24607329842931938,0.26399808401644953,47.4587102249858,0.1942675159235669,0.8154606480543513,0.0,0.6443354791275547,0.31199479214582454,0.7620840668678284,0.15533980582524273,0.23677905840524602,43.395521466735474,0.09023354564755838,0.7684907546226887,0.0,0.5925759039819241,0.27508703194907097
endocrinology,obesity,Is prior bariatric surgery associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity is an independent risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but there is little evidence on whether prior bariatric surgery benefits the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. We aimed to summarize this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of current case-control studies.

METHODS:
We searched several electronic databases for case-control studies conducted between January 2020 and March 2022. We compared the rates of mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, dialysis, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay between COVID-19 patients with and without a history of bariatric surgery.

RESULTS:
We included six studies with 137â903 patients; 5270 (3.8%) had prior bariatric surgery, while 132â633 (96.2%) did not. COVID-19 patients with a history of bariatric surgery had significantly lower mortality (odds ratio (OR)â=â0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI)â=â0.23-0.74), ICU admission (ORâ=â0.48; 95% CIâ=â0.36-0.65), and mechanical ventilation rates than those with a history of non-bariatric surgery (ORâ=â0.51; 95% CIâ=â0.35-0.75).

CONCLUSIONS:
Prior bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of mortality and reduced severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity compared to those with no prior bariatric surgery. Further large-sample prospective studies are needed to support these results.

","Bariatric surgery is associated with significant health benefits for patients with obesity-related comorbidities such as CVD, T2DM, OSA, and GORD. However, it is important to be aware of the potential for post-operative complications, such as post-operative vomiting, atelectasis/pneumonia, fever/infection, and electrolyte imbalance. Additionally, obese patients have an increased risk of bacterial infections, and may require higher doses of medications. Research suggests that mortality rates associated with bariatric surgery can be low (0.07% in the UK National Bariatric Surgical Register), but outcomes can be poor if patients are not in optimal health prior to surgery. In regards to COVID-19, obese patients may experience delayed viral shedding, and self-isolation periods should be longer for patients with obesity. Therefore, prior bariatric surgery could be associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes if a patient is not in optimal health ahead of time.",0.8399016261100769,0.2105263157894737,0.1617598286154784,25.110758119118596,0.07253886010362694,1.0,0.0,0.6328033233477064,0.33485749063724063,0.8793296813964844,0.32727272727272727,0.31268941206495043,37.40674185698649,0.14893617021276595,1.0,0.0,0.7142712593763724,0.37155301439465405,0.8216674327850342,0.18772563176895307,0.10529608006672227,13.974310958324986,0.053742802303262956,1.0,0.0,0.581172998277297,0.3321453229379729,0.8161234855651855,0.19491525423728817,0.09056177235220977,16.554180744244434,0.06235294117647059,1.0,0.0,0.5864756196401173,0.3286226294852669,0.8942350745201111,0.32911392405063294,0.3938869125631904,42.39289820010491,0.17058823529411765,0.7876447876447876,0.0,0.7458149632986855,0.38417890344337874,0.8175002932548523,0.1749049429657795,0.09811065091782993,14.91345352422104,0.05473684210526316,1.0,0.0,0.5776336353023847,0.3248123821743506,0.8251031637191772,0.19742489270386265,0.10211569362613819,17.280539406178494,0.06388206388206388,1.0,0.0,0.5899301057386582,0.33133883592041496,0.8655635714530945,0.23529411764705882,0.30544354838709675,43.04369181868619,0.10126582278481013,0.7927927927927927,0.0,0.7080379931463135,0.34817827219238273,0.8013530373573303,0.15053763440860216,0.07680192248364104,13.958846585481272,0.05511022044088176,1.0,0.0,0.5462513254196556,0.3119410715627265,0.8058755993843079,0.17073170731707318,0.08244691010748208,16.21239164886123,0.06380510440835267,1.0,0.0,0.5553227457211172,0.31618139179742094,0.8517062067985535,0.22535211267605634,0.27508960573476704,38.1624997977364,0.0949367088607595,0.8326403326403327,0.0,0.6872859633550411,0.33879872653185955,0.8271478414535522,0.20833333333333334,0.12489665187404599,20.344933261873983,0.061488673139158574,1.0,0.0,0.5971529818278678,0.327015659058222,0.7982366681098938,0.17204301075268816,0.11524024024024022,18.029170635331678,0.05384615384615385,1.0,0.0,0.5441357710739462,0.30517542037089285

To systematically review the efficacy of short length of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) in laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB).

METHODS:
By thoroughly investigating in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, each research containing the comparison between short BPL and 200-cm BPL was included, inception in July 2021. The research followed the guidance of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) recommendations.

RESULT:
A total of 1288 patients were included for meta-analysis. Results showed that in the short term, compared with 200-cm BPL, percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) did not show significant reduction (pâ=â0.91), neither did the incidence of vitamin D deficiency (pâ=â0.87) nor hypoalbuminemia (pâ=â0.06), while percentage total weight loss (%TWL) was significantly higher in the 200-cm BPL group (pâ=â0.0005). At 1, 2, and 8Â years postoperatively, patients with short BPL still obtained significantly reduced body mass index (BMI).

CONCLUSION:
Short BPL shows significant effect of weight loss; however, it seems no significantly lower rates of adverse events in the short term are found. More research with randomized controlled design is encouraged to further address the incidence of adverse events in the long term.",To systematically review the efficacy of short length of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) in laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB).,"By thoroughly investigating in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, each research containing the comparison between short BPL and 200-cm BPL was included, inception in July 2021.

The length of the biliopancreatic limb (BPL) is a crucial factor for the success of the procedure [1][2]. A BPL length of 150 cm is found to be safe and effective [4], while a length of >200 cm is associated with an increased risk of protein-calorie malnutrition [4]. A short BPL length in OAGB has shown significant weight loss and resolution of comorbidities [5], although nutritional deficiencies were noted [5]. A study comparing OAGB with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) found OAGB as effective in weight loss and metabolic improvement, but with higher incidences of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional adverse events with a 200 cm BPL [6]. Another study found OAGB to be as safe as other commonly performed procedures, with excellent weight loss results [8].

TL;DR: Short length of biliopancreatic limb in one-anastomosis gastric bypass is effective for significant weight loss and remission of comorbidities, but may result in nutritional deficiencies.

The first study, with a sample size of 52 patients, found that short biliopancreatic limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (S-BPL-RYGB) was effective in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in 95% of patients who had previously undergone OAGB. However, the study design and the decision-making process for the revisional procedure, based on pH impedance testing, may introduce bias [1]. The second study, with a larger sample size of 527 patients, demonstrated the safety and efficacy of OAGB/mini-gastric bypass (MGB) in terms of weight loss, remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), resolution of hypertension, and improvement of sleep apnea symptoms. However, the retrospective design and lack of a control group, as well as the potential bias introduced by the two senior surgeons conducting the study, may influence the results [2].

","The single anastomosis duodenoileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy is endorsed as an appropriate primary metabolic bariatric surgery that has been shown to have similar weight loss as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. The procedure involves the transection of a portion of the duodenum and has been found to have few anastomotic complications, internal hernias, volvulus and bowel obstructions due to needing one fewer anastomosis than typical surgeries. Despite this, chronic diarrhea has been found to occur in patients with shorter biliopancreatic limb lengths. In order to address this, ""distalization"" or revision of the jejunojejunostomy anastomosis has been found to increase biliopancreatic limb length without sacrificing too much of the common channel, resulting in renewed weight loss and comorbidity control.

endocrinology,thyroid disease,Does rituximab improve clinical outcomes of patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The current therapies of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) were still a challenging matter. In this study, we aimed to contrast the impact of before- after rituximab (RTX) therapy in the patients with TAO.

METHODS:
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases for articles published up to July 3, 2017. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was used to provide pooled estimates of standard mean difference (SMD) both the primary outcome from clinical activity score (CAS), and secondary outcomes from thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb), proptosis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. In addition, the quality and each study was assessed using either the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) or the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and reliability of the meta-analytic result using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

RESULTS:
Of the 839 articles initially searched, 11 studies were finally eligible for inclusion. Subgroup analysis results showed that comparing with initial value, there was a decline in CAS at 1,3,6,12Â month after RTX treatment, decreased TRAbs level at 6,12Â month, proptosis improvement at least 1Â month, unchanged IL-6 level at 6Â month, decreased TSH level at 3Â month but unchanged at 12Â month. All included studies were classified as good quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
The pooled data suggested that the preliminary effects of RTX treatment on TAO might be promising. However, more large-sample and high-quality studies targeting RTX use during this disease and long-term surveillance of prognosis are urgently needed.","The current therapies of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) were still a challenging matter.

However, more large-sample and high-quality studies targeting RTX use during this disease and long-term surveillance of prognosis are urgently needed."," The use of rituximab in the treatment of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) has been explored in several studies with varying results. Some studies suggest potential benefits of rituximab in treating TAO, particularly in cases resistant to conventional glucocorticoid therapy [2][5][10][12][14][15]. A case series involving six corticosteroid-resistant patients showed improvement in inflammatory score, visual acuity, and visual field after rituximab treatment [10]. Similarly, a prospective clinical trial involving 12 patients showed a significant decrease in Clinical Activity Scores (CAS) following rituximab treatment [12]. A retrospective case series also demonstrated significant improvement in CAS after rituximab treatment in corticosteroid-resistant patients [14]. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results [1][4][7][13]. One RCT showed a strong benefit of rituximab compared to intravenous glucocorticoids, while another found no benefit compared to placebo [13]. Given these mixed results, further large-scale RCTs are needed to establish the role of rituximab in TAO treatment.

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that rituximab may improve clinical outcomes in some patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, particularly those resistant to conventional glucocorticoid therapy. However, results from randomized controlled trials have been mixed, indicating a need for further research to conclusively determine the efficacy of rituximab in this context.

These results suggest that rituximab-based therapy could be a viable option for managing TAO in patients who do not show adequate response to conventional treatments.",0.7521076202392578,0.0903954802259887,0.16630730336173108,30.844670470441756,0.07671957671957672,0.8599948146227637,0.0,0.5517663592550935,0.2635982804098407,0.7524834275245667,0.11249999999999999,0.22149255433058376,34.48649537308175,0.09090909090909091,0.7741768213637542,0.0,0.5266843831146156,0.2556327776988969,0.7395922541618347,0.0924092409240924,0.08213552361396304,16.610719185653753,0.0367504835589942,1.0,0.0,0.505999672207928,0.2693256760836772,0.745915412902832,0.11067193675889328,0.09839461418953908,20.604647022156502,0.044444444444444446,1.0,0.0,0.5239069803997323,0.2748556099664327,0.7447349429130554,0.07042253521126761,0.15097690941385436,29.214216467494946,0.045454545454545456,0.7295825771324864,0.0,0.545201343056318,0.251343231863302,0.7692193984985352,0.1003344481605351,0.09349955476402493,18.436596628905527,0.045454545454545456,1.0,0.0,0.5277562866156752,0.28671349415958824,0.7776648998260498,0.11811023622047244,0.12229238349746745,21.55129750968753,0.054959785522788206,1.0,0.0,0.5400378423008493,0.29068655845533914,0.7628143429756165,0.0875912408759124,0.1669941060903733,29.833222612165024,0.040106951871657755,0.7422867513611615,0.0,0.5865094212063572,0.2641254755531733,0.7809961438179016,0.12258064516129033,0.12711043478260872,19.42137532463333,0.054989816700611,1.0,0.0,0.5353920141425295,0.29591655442925,0.784434974193573,0.1391941391941392,0.14160347618641903,21.97436225261136,0.058394160583941604,1.0,0.0,0.5509296105032073,0.3002348544406003,0.7650882005691528,0.12403100775193798,0.16706443914081145,29.32006734590068,0.034759358288770054,0.7676950998185118,0.0,0.5730746187725846,0.2593755210205186,0.7689923048019409,0.11965811965811966,0.1423666422855071,25.97346962015012,0.06957928802588997,1.0,0.0,0.5650643240308987,0.29082270818278166,0.7654524445533752,0.14634146341463414,0.17437252774179998,27.092556473850998,0.07234042553191489,1.0,0.0,0.5458319082594755,0.277413475976029
family medicine,family medicine,What can family physicians offer patients with carpal tunnel syndrome other than surgery? A systematic review of nonsurgical management.,"BACKGROUND:
We undertook a literature review to produce evidence-based recommendations for nonsurgical family physician management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

METHODS:
Study design was systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CTS treatment. Data sources were English publications from all relevant databases, hand searches, and guidelines. Outcomes measured were nonsurgical management options for CTS.

RESULTS:
We assessed 2 systematic reviews, 16 RCTs, and 1 before-and-after study using historical controls. A considerable percentage of CTS resolves spontaneously. There is strong evidence that local corticosteroid injections, and to a lesser extent oral corticosteroids, give short-term relief for CTS sufferers. There is limited evidence to indicate that splinting, laser-acupuncture, yoga, and therapeutic ultrasound may be effective in the short to medium term (up to 6 months). The evidence for nerve and tendon gliding exercises is even more tentative. The evidence does not support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), chiropractic treatment, or magnet treatment.

CONCLUSIONS:
For those who are not able to get surgery or for those who do not want surgery, there are some conservative modalities that can be tried. These modalities include ones for which there is good evidence. It would be reasonable to try some of the techniques with less evidence if the better ones are not successful. Reconsideration of surgery must always be kept in mind to avoid permanent nerve damage.",We undertook a literature review to produce evidence-based recommendations for nonsurgical family physician management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).,"Study design was systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CTS treatment.

These include:

1. Wrist Splinting: A splint that holds the wrist still while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness. 

2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation.

3. Corticosteroids: These can be taken orally or injected into the carpal tunnel to reduce inflammation and swelling.

4. Nerve gliding exercises: Some people may benefit from exercises that help the median nerve move more freely within the confines of the carpal tunnel.

5. Lifestyle changes: This may include avoiding activities that worsen symptoms, taking frequent breaks, and modifying the way certain tasks are performed.

6. Physical therapy: This can include ultrasound therapy, exercises, and other modalities to help reduce symptoms.

7. Occupational therapy: This can help modify the work environment to reduce strain on the wrist.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.","Family physicians can offer patients with carpal tunnel syndrome a variety of non-surgical treatment options. These may include:

1. Wrist splints: Family physicians can provide patients with wrist splints to wear during activities that aggravate their symptoms. Splints help to keep the wrist in a neutral position, reducing pressure on the median nerve.

2. Medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can be prescribed to help reduce pain and inflammation associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.

3. Corticosteroid injections: Family physicians can administer corticosteroid injections into the carpal tunnel to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. This treatment is typically reserved for patients with more severe symptoms.

4. Occupational therapy: Family physicians may refer patients to occupational therapists who can provide exercises and techniques to improve wrist strength and flexibility, as well as educate patients on ergonomic modifications to reduce symptoms.

5. Lifestyle modifications: Family physicians can advise patients on lifestyle changes that may help alleviate symptoms, such as taking regular breaks from repetitive activities, using proper ergonomics at workstations, and avoiding activities that worsen symptoms.

6. Physical therapy: Family physicians may refer patients to physical therapists who can provide specific exercises and stretches to improve wrist and hand function, as well as address any underlying musculoskeletal imbalances.

It is important to note that the specific treatment approach may vary depending on the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as individual patient factors. Family physicians will assess each patient's unique situation and tailor the treatment plan accordingly.","These papers suggest that family physicians have several non-surgical options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

Other modalities, such as laser-acupuncture, yoga, and therapeutic ultrasound, may also be effective in the short to medium term. Burke 2007 found that primary care physicians underutilize non-operative treatment options, such as splintage and steroid injections, before referring patients for surgery. Bland 2007 suggests that surgical decompression is not always effective and that neutral-angle wrist splinting and steroids are the only other interventions that are clearly of benefit.

Medical journal search engines included Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus spanning all previous years up to July 30, 2022. Both aerobic and strength/resistance training protocols were included. The mean difference (MD, 95% confidence interval) in monthly migraine frequency from baseline to end-of-intervention between the active and control arms was used as an outcome measure. Efficacy evidence from direct and indirect comparisons was combined by conducting a random effects model network meta-analysis. The efficacy of the three exercise protocols was compared, i.e., moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise, and strength/resistance training. Studies that compared the efficacy of migraine medications (topiramate, amitriptyline) to exercise were included. Additionally, the risk of bias in all included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2).

RESULTS:
There were 21 published clinical trials that involved a total of 1195 migraine patients with a mean age of 35Â years and a female-to-male ratio of 6.7. There were 27 pairwise comparisons and 8 indirect comparisons. The rank of the interventions was as follows: strength training (MDâ=â-3.55 [-â6.15,â-â0.95]), high-intensity aerobic exercise (-3.13 [-5.28, -0.97]), moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (-2.18 [-3.25, -1.11]), topiramate (-0.98 [-4.16, 2.20]), placebo, amitriptyline (3.82 [-â1.03, 8.68]). The RoB2 assessment showed that 85% of the included studies demonstrated low risk of bias, while 15% indicated high risk of bias for intention-to-treat analysis. Sources of high risk of bias include randomization process and handling of missing outcome data.

CONCLUSION:
Strength training exercise regimens demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing migraine burden, followed by high-intensity aerobic exercise.","Multiple clinical trials with different exercise protocols have demonstrated efficacy in the management of migraine.

A systematic review and meta-analysis found that aerobic exercise can decrease the number of migraine days, although there was insufficient evidence regarding the effects on pain intensity and duration of attacks [2]. Another review suggested that aerobic exercise can reduce pain intensity, frequency, and duration of attacks, and medication use [3]. A systematic review evaluating different exercise intensities found positive effects of exercise on migraine symptoms, tension-type headache, and a decrease in the use of headache-related medications [4]. A randomized controlled trial with 52 participants showed significant improvements in physical fitness, level of physical activity, migraine burden, and the ability to engage in physical activity due to reduced impact of tension-type headache and neck pain in the exercise group [5]. Another review suggested that a rigorous aerobic exercise regimen alone can significantly reduce migraine frequency, intensity, and duration [6]. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis with a larger sample size of 2776 participants suggested that while aerobic training had a small to moderate clinical effect on pain intensity and medication use in patients with migraine, strength training had a moderate clinical effect on pain intensity in patients with tension-type headache [13]. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, and there were concerns about the transparency, replicability, and risk of bias in the included studies.

Although varying levels of disability and responsiveness to treatments have been observed within the vestibular migraine population, overall aerobic exercise and strength training both have potential benefits towards alleviating migraine symptoms.",0.8039594888687134,0.10937499999999997,0.05772646536412077,13.19006503828484,0.030864197530864196,1.0,0.0,0.5033738343719987,0.28161869452184896,0.7822694778442383,0.10937499999999997,0.07843367596671562,14.569592483209645,0.02040816326530612,1.0,0.0,0.46292702497347543,0.2692582730263785,0.7555503845214844,0.060240963855421686,0.03355883492637562,6.3504363727630615,0.013669064748201438,1.0,0.0,0.4303565877921802,0.25948035307530054,0.7614966630935669,0.06642066420664207,0.03260352684763225,7.564392757030195,0.016814159292035398,1.0,0.0,0.43847579634378825,0.2613353464260936,0.8155009746551514,0.1038961038961039,0.14062681876382258,24.60712309195713,0.029411764705882353,1.0,0.0,0.5341143857906846,0.29840351370932255,0.7337714433670044,0.06639004149377593,0.03530282598499061,7.8820310982999935,0.01282051282051282,1.0,0.0,0.3891366721804325,0.2402682343182974,0.7392241954803467,0.07329842931937174,0.03934118164604173,9.921680189756483,0.014989293361884369,1.0,0.0,0.39530997749231034,0.2456687116740415,0.8186811804771423,0.18181818181818182,0.16333478916858568,27.79165613992681,0.04672897196261682,1.0,0.0,0.5038373533819542,0.2825594847141291,0.7607546448707581,0.13235294117647056,0.06252503087140805,9.775668573224488,0.045454545454545456,1.0,0.0,0.4181489409743876,0.27136813883816135,0.7796122431755066,0.1559633027522936,0.07638613552853689,12.380400167061277,0.05798687089715536,1.0,0.0,0.4415310441159216,0.2843276834364227,0.8046877980232239,0.17142857142857146,0.18257127487896715,27.23728904764015,0.06521739130434782,1.0,0.0,0.46547415590769536,0.27935816952832543,0.7982119917869568,0.1183431952662722,0.08253750666362045,11.247199795361139,0.026813880126182965,1.0,0.0,0.4989400922643895,0.2902723426700616,0.7998121380805969,0.11965811965811965,0.09144430047946309,13.158214935802176,0.028169014084507043,1.0,0.0,0.5011834724673203,0.2755196815971637
family medicine,adult procedures,What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:
The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.

METHODS:
Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively.

RESULTS:
A total of 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. In total, 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association.

CONCLUSIONS:
Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19-related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.",The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.,"Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020.

This finding is consistent with the results of several observational studies. A cohort study with 1830 patients aged â¥50 years found that higher levels of frailty were associated with increased mortality within 30 days and 6 months of admission [5]. Another retrospective cohort study with 450 patients also indicated a high inpatient mortality rate, particularly for patients over 80 years old [6]. A longitudinal observational study with 711 patients aged â¥50 years found that older age and frailty were associated with unspecific COVID-19 presentations and that reporting fever was associated with lower odds of mortality [8]. Lastly, a retrospective single-center observational study with 81 patients found that frailty, as measured by the CFS, was weakly associated with mortality and that even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19 if sufficient resources are available [9].

TL;DR: Higher levels of frailty, as measured by validated scales, are associated with increased mortality in adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care. However, even the most frail patients may benefit from hospitalization if sufficient resources are available.

Higher frailty scores, which indicate a greater degree of frailty, have been associated with increased mortality rates in these patients. This is likely due to the fact that frail individuals often have multiple comorbidities and a reduced physiological reserve, making them more susceptible to severe outcomes from COVID-19.""","Several studies have shown that there is a significant relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care. Frailty scores, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) or the Rockwood Frailty Index (RFI), are commonly used to assess the overall health and functional status of older adults. 

A study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society in 2020 found that higher frailty scores were associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The study included 1,409 adults aged 18 years or older with confirmed COVID-19. It concluded that frailty scores can be useful in predicting mortality risk in this population.

Another study published in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association in 2021 also demonstrated a strong association between frailty scores and mortality in COVID-19 patients. The study included 1,564 adults aged 65 years or older who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. It found that higher frailty scores were independently associated with increased mortality risk.

These findings suggest that validated frailty scores can serve as valuable tools in assessing the prognosis and mortality risk of adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care. Identifying frailty in these patients can help healthcare providers make informed decisions regarding treatment strategies and resource allocation.","These papers suggest that there is a positive association between frailty and mortality in hospitalized adults with COVID-19.

","The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a validated score that has been found to be strongly associated with mortality rate among adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care. Studies have shown that increasing scores on the CFS are linearly correlated with increased mortality. The CFS can also act as a predictive factor for poorer outcomes in emergency department visits and other care settings, such as nursing homes and intensive care units. Additionally, the FRAIL scale can provide an easy screening tool for frailty and assess fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and weight loss. Lastly, geriatric trauma-specific frailty indexes have been developed which use 15 different variables to aid clinicians in discharge planning.

family medicine,anxiety disorders,What is the prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence in cancer survivors and patients? A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
Care for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is considered the most common unmet need among cancer survivors. Yet the prevalence of FCR and predisposing factors remain inconclusive. To support targeted care, we provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and severity of FCR among cancer survivors and patients, as measured using the short form of the validated Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI-SF). We also report on associations between FCR and clinical and demographic characteristics.

METHODS:
This is a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis on the prevalence of FCR. In the review, we included all studies that used the FCRI-SF with adult (â¥18Â years) cancer survivors and patients. Date of search: 7 February 2020. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool.

RESULTS:
IPD were requested from 87 unique studies and provided for 46 studies comprising 11,226 participants from 13 countries. 9311 respondents were included for the main analyses. On the FCRI-SF (range 0-36), 58.8% of respondents scored â¥13, 45.1% scored â¥16 and 19.2% scored â¥22. FCR decreased with age and women reported more FCR than men. FCR was found across cancer types and continents and for all time periods since cancer diagnosis.

CONCLUSIONS:
FCR affects a considerable number of cancer survivors and patients. It is therefore important that healthcare providers discuss this issue with their patients and provide treatment when needed. Further research is needed to investigate how best to prevent and treat FCR and to identify other factors associated with FCR. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42020142185).","Care for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is considered the most common unmet need among cancer survivors.

An interprofessional approach to care and surveillance is recommended to minimize the risk of recurrence and improve overall patient care.",0.7186335921287537,0.11188811188811189,0.10391503993384257,13.175976939101005,0.03980099502487562,1.0,0.0,0.48442539994695544,0.23968766821505227,0.7513170838356018,0.12328767123287673,0.12962962962962962,14.70848002419186,0.05429864253393665,1.0,0.0,0.5139253047423634,0.26686064418641353,0.6903349757194519,0.11290322580645162,0.047829286239882265,9.589319147414228,0.02461799660441426,1.0,0.0,0.41274081910840976,0.23071017635355803,0.6813594102859497,0.13333333333333333,0.06273747925095964,12.044307027545045,0.028199566160520606,1.0,0.0,0.4018296969157678,0.22733260156967894,0.7415176630020142,0.12,0.1430976430976431,22.179739991551585,0.07692307692307693,1.0,0.0,0.5192839279770851,0.24854315074973748,0.7594461441040039,0.12056737588652483,0.0607255649891309,9.592103806257612,0.029812606473594547,1.0,0.0,0.5024855334953239,0.2800454928232841,0.7625334858894348,0.12448132780082989,0.07253331373701745,11.604199403508202,0.03578732106339468,1.0,0.0,0.516070944594226,0.2840133639922286,0.7169194221496582,0.1818181818181818,0.1525054466230937,24.302498097685405,0.06880733944954129,0.9485849056603773,0.0,0.5134674259956847,0.22936618530519842,0.7582875490188599,0.12121212121212122,0.06355063550635505,10.876503253625875,0.03672316384180791,1.0,0.0,0.5107715683807801,0.2787561848203089,0.7641370296478271,0.12264150943396228,0.07974481658692187,13.211867810909125,0.045454545454545456,1.0,0.0,0.5350296282792981,0.2840411902299862,0.7352215647697449,0.1414141414141414,0.14756944444444445,22.61996866871931,0.0752212389380531,1.0,0.0,0.5070276279603282,0.24777135483965873,0.7483835816383362,0.15384615384615385,0.10936132983377078,13.730384387457843,0.0502092050209205,1.0,0.0,0.5151637984623372,0.25964823991976643,0.6849616169929504,0.10256410256410257,0.07168458781362007,12.127240498651027,0.032188841201716736,1.0,0.0,0.41792764684983663,0.21001107382666012
family medicine,breast cancer,"Does Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radiotherapy have a Better Survival than Mastectomy? A Meta-Analysis of More than 1,500,000 Patients.","BACKGROUND:
There have been conflicting studies reporting on survival advantages between breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapyÂ (BCS) in comparison with mastectomy. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of BCS and mastectomy in terms of overall survival (OS) comparing all past published studies.

METHODS:
We performed a comprehensive review of literature through October 2021 in PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE. The studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts that compare BCS versus mastectomy. We excluded studies that included male sex, stage 0, distant metastasis at diagnosis, bilateral synchronous cancer, neoadjuvant radiation/chemotherapy, and articles with incomplete data. We performed a meta-analysis following the random-effect model with the inverse variance method.

RESULTS:
From 18,997 publications, a total of 30 studies were included in the final analysis: 6 studies were randomized trials, and 24 were retrospective cohorts. A total of 1,802,128 patients with a follow-up ranging from 4 to 20 years were included, and 1,075,563 and 744,565 underwent BCS and mastectomy, respectively. Among the population, BCS is associated with improved OS compared with mastectomy [relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.74]. This effect was similar when analysis was performed in cohorts and multi-institutional databases (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49-0.67). Furthermore, the benefit of BCS was stronger in patients who had less than 10 years of follow-up (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46-0.64).

CONCLUSIONS:
Patients who underwent BCS had better OS compared with mastectomy. Such results depicting survival advantage, especially using such a large sample of patients, may need to be included in the shared surgical decision making when discussing breast cancer treatment with patients.",There have been conflicting studies reporting on survival advantages between breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapyÂ (BCS) in comparison with mastectomy.

A population-based study with a large sample size (n=4,333) found that older women with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with BCS+RT had better overall and breast cancer-specific survival compared to those treated with mastectomy [3]. A retrospective cohort study (n=26,279) also suggested that BCS+RT was associated with better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy [5]. However, another retrospective cohort study (n=3,536) found no significant difference in overall survival between BCS+RT and mastectomy in young Asian women with early-stage breast cancer [10]. A long-term follow-up of a randomized trial (n=701) found similar rates of death from all causes and death from breast cancer between the two groups [11]. Another population-based study (n=45,770) suggested that BCS+RT is at least equivalent to total mastectomy in terms of overall survival [12]. A randomized controlled trial (n=1,326) found that postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy resulted in a modest reduction in local recurrence in older women with early breast cancer, but no differences in overall survival were observed between the two groups [8].

TL;DR: The evidence suggests that breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy may offer similar or better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy in certain patient populations, but the findings are not consistent across all studies and patient groups.

However, in certain patient subgroups, such as older patients with triple-negative breast cancer [3], BCS with RT may have improved overall and breast cancer-specific survival rates compared to other surgical approaches. A large retrospective study of stage I-III breast cancer patients found that BCS plus RT improved survival rates for patients with ER-positive tumors [4]. Health-related quality of life outcomes following BCS were comparable to mastectomy, with some evidence suggesting better physical health and body image in the BCS group [5]. In terms of ductal carcinoma in situ, total mastectomy had the lowest recurrence rate compared to BCS+RT, but the study did not reach a conclusion regarding survival outcomes [6]. A population-based study in Korean women with early breast cancer found better overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival in the BCS+RT group compared to total mastectomy [7]. In patients with metaplastic breast cancer, BCS+RT was associated with higher overall survival compared to mastectomy [8]. Lastly, a retrospective cohort study found that patients with stage II cancer and high comorbidity had higher hazard ratios for death [9].

A large population-based study in the Netherlands found that BCS had better breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) than mastectomy in all subgroups except for patients under 40 years with T1-2N0-1 stage [3]. A similar outcome was observed in a study of Korean women with early breast cancer, where BCS plus RT had better OS and BCSS compared to total mastectomy [2]. A comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts also found that BCS was associated with improved OS compared to mastectomy [8]. However, the survival benefit of BCS plus RT may not be consistent across all patient subgroups. For instance, a study in older women with triple-negative breast cancer found that BCS plus RT led to better overall and breast cancer-specific survival compared to BCS alone, mastectomy, or mastectomy plus radiotherapy [11]. Meanwhile, a large retrospective study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database found that BCS plus RT had significantly higher OS and BCSS compared to mastectomy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCIS-MI) [10]. It's important to note that these studies vary in their design and population, and some studies did not find a significant difference in survival between BCS (with or without RT) and mastectomy [1, 7, 9].

A population-based study with a large sample size (n=4,333) found that older women with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with BCS+RT had better overall and breast cancer-specific survival compared to those treated with mastectomy [3]. A retrospective cohort study (n=26,279) also suggested that BCS+RT was associated with better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy [5]. However, another retrospective cohort study (n=3,536) found no significant difference in overall survival between BCS+RT and mastectomy in young Asian women with early-stage breast cancer [10]. A long-term follow-up of a randomized trial (n=701) found similar rates of death from all causes and death from breast cancer between the two groups [11]. Another population-based study (n=45,770) suggested that BCS+RT is at least equivalent to total mastectomy in terms of overall survival [12]. A randomized controlled trial (n=1,326) found that postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy resulted in a modest reduction in local recurrence in older women with early breast cancer, but no differences in overall survival were observed between the two groups [8].

"," The evidence suggests that breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy may offer similar or better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy in certain patient populations, but the findings are not consistent across all studies and patient groups.

"," The evidence from the provided articles suggests that breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy (RT) does not have significantly different survival rates compared to mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients [1,2,10]. However, in certain patient subgroups, such as older patients with triple-negative breast cancer [3], BCS with RT may have improved overall and breast cancer-specific survival rates compared to other surgical approaches. A large retrospective study of stage I-III breast cancer patients found that BCS plus RT improved survival rates for patients with ER-positive tumors [4]. Health-related quality of life outcomes following BCS were comparable to mastectomy, with some evidence suggesting better physical health and body image in the BCS group [5]. In terms of ductal carcinoma in situ, total mastectomy had the lowest recurrence rate compared to BCS+RT, but the study did not reach a conclusion regarding survival outcomes [6]. A population-based study in Korean women with early breast cancer found better overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival in the BCS+RT group compared to total mastectomy [7]. In patients with metaplastic breast cancer, BCS+RT was associated with higher overall survival compared to mastectomy [8]. Lastly, a retrospective cohort study found that patients with stage II cancer and high comorbidity had higher hazard ratios for death [9].

"," Current evidence suggests that survival rates are generally similar between breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy and mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer, but certain subgroups may experience better survival with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy.

"," The majority of studies suggest that breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy (RT) may lead to better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy in certain patient populations. A large population-based study in the Netherlands found that BCS had better breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) than mastectomy in all subgroups except for patients under 40 years with T1-2N0-1 stage [3]. A similar outcome was observed in a study of Korean women with early breast cancer, where BCS plus RT had better OS and BCSS compared to total mastectomy [2]. A comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts also found that BCS was associated with improved OS compared to mastectomy [8]. However, the survival benefit of BCS plus RT may not be consistent across all patient subgroups. For instance, a study in older women with triple-negative breast cancer found that BCS plus RT led to better overall and breast cancer-specific survival compared to BCS alone, mastectomy, or mastectomy plus radiotherapy [11]. Meanwhile, a large retrospective study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database found that BCS plus RT had significantly higher OS and BCSS compared to mastectomy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCIS-MI) [10]. It's important to note that these studies vary in their design and population, and some studies did not find a significant difference in survival between BCS (with or without RT) and mastectomy [1, 7, 9].

"," Current evidence suggests that breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy may lead to better survival outcomes compared to mastectomy in certain patient populations, although the benefit may vary depending on specific patient characteristics and cancer stages.

","The results of the NSABP B-06 trial have shown that breast-conserving surgery (BCT) combined with radiation therapy is equivalent to radical mastectomy in terms of disease free and overall survival for tumors less than 4 cm. This result has been reinforced with 20 years of follow-up data and by multiple studies from the European Milan Cancer Institute. Consequently, BCT is now the standard of care when compared to mastectomy for treatment of non-invasive and localized invasive breast cancer, with radiation therapy being used as an adjuvant therapy. The decision should be patient-specific with acceptable cosmesis and a tumor size of 5 cm considered as a cutoff for selection of BCT. Overall, BCT with radiotherapy has an equivalent survival outcome to mastectomy.",0.7546748518943787,0.12790697674418605,0.1858852746874923,33.21116766786915,0.0539906103286385,0.8752062365946214,0.0,0.5706452299850155,0.26073543568329166,0.7448420524597168,0.09302325581395347,0.1845444059976932,33.72285582413947,0.06103286384976526,0.8813672111312765,0.0,0.5402448432347209,0.24936854643553072,0.7732422351837158,0.11594202898550725,0.11915258184721852,19.07610907081507,0.053228621291448515,1.0,0.0,0.5576892828338602,0.2877109280675139,0.7718944549560547,0.12337662337662338,0.12112104670673947,21.29101553263211,0.059837728194726165,1.0,0.0,0.5620515940638332,0.2887412787383483,0.7620782852172852,0.09375,0.17605633802816903,36.71426216634947,0.025821596244131457,0.7586206896551724,0.0,0.615479308505391,0.26562741942168294,0.7814808487892151,0.12571428571428572,0.11591240047657772,17.97469559410366,0.05184534270650264,1.0,0.0,0.5801272664417406,0.2945661456051185,0.7834444642066956,0.1405750798722045,0.127074090184138,21.00078011065378,0.059837728194726165,1.0,0.0,0.5937867146907466,0.2987316997105932,0.7492825388908386,0.09375,0.1683276616431697,31.356735786283252,0.028169014084507043,0.7531760435571688,0.0,0.5888010372920912,0.25631433410798654,0.7860841751098633,0.13333333333333333,0.11832920868952877,19.091971910098668,0.06998444790046657,1.0,0.0,0.585448921400698,0.29986591747632063,0.7889162302017212,0.14792899408284024,0.12385940703452973,21.585228149453446,0.07904085257548846,1.0,0.0,0.5971384002481188,0.3041529339231616,0.75999516248703,0.109375,0.2327111457673376,40.035657859098,0.03286384976525822,0.7422867513611615,0.0,0.6127782734327538,0.2649283002693916,0.7761691808700562,0.1636363636363636,0.17293740693608722,27.493462225348907,0.08555133079847908,1.0,0.0,0.6130904809668146,0.28804215425139096,0.7731483578681946,0.1278538812785388,0.17839578454332553,30.15234877850219,0.08494208494208494,1.0,0.0,0.5840031887803759,0.2844640245894484
family medicine,child and adolescent mental disorders,What Role for Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics in Managing Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders in Children and Adolescents? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIAs) are an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment in adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, there is less evidence for their use in children and adolescents.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim of this systematic review was to summarize findings regarding the effectiveness and side effects of LAIA in children and adolescents with SSD.

METHODS:
Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDES, and Dialnet) were systematically searched for articles published between inception and 12 March, 2022, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) original articles or case reports; (2) providing data on efficacy/effectiveness or safety/tolerability of LAIA treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with SSD (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, non-affective psychotic disorder); (3) mean age of samples â¤â18 years; and (4) written in English or Spanish. Exclusion criteria were review articles, clinical guides, expert consensus as well as posters or oral communication in conferences. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS tool.

RESULTS:
From 847 articles found, 13 met the inclusion criteria. These included seven single case reports or case series, four retrospective chart reviews, a 24-week open-label trial, and one observational prospective study, covering a total of 119 adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with SSD. Almost all the articles described data on second-generation LAIA (53 patients on risperidone [once every other week], 33 on paliperidone palmitate [once monthly], 10 on aripiprazole [once monthly], and two on olanzapine pamoate [once monthly]). Twenty-one patients were reported to be only on first-generation LAIAs. Non-adherence was the main reason for starting an LAIA. In all of the studies, the use of LAIAs was associated with improvement in the patients' symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS:
There are few studies assessing the use of LAIAs in adolescents with SSD. Overall, these treatments have suggested good effectiveness and acceptable safety and tolerability. However, we found no studies examining their use in children aged <â12 years. The problems and benefits linked to this type of antipsychotic formulation in the child and adolescent population require further study, ideally with prospective, controlled designs.",The aim of this systematic review was to summarize findings regarding the effectiveness and side effects of LAIA in children and adolescents with SSD.,"Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDES, and Dialnet) were systematically searched for articles published between inception and 12 March, 2022, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) original articles or case reports; (2) providing data on efficacy/effectiveness or safety/tolerability of LAIA treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with SSD (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, non-affective psychotic disorder); (3) mean age of samples â¤â18 years; and (4) written in English or Spanish.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 92 trials with a total of 22,645 participants showed that LAIs were more effective than placebo in preventing relapse, with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and paliperidone identified as the best choices for maintenance treatment [10]. Another meta-analysis of 19 treatment cohorts consisting of 5130 individuals found a lower incidence of relapse among individuals with prospectively determined symptom remission (PSR) compared to those without PSR [4]. Treatment adherence and attitude towards medication were found to be negatively associated with symptom scores [5]. However, some patients may experience breakthrough psychotic symptoms on antipsychotic maintenance medication [7]. A literature review involving children and adolescents reported clinical improvement in most cases, with common side effects including weight gain, tremor, and oculogyric crisis [6]. The use of LAIs in this population is still under-studied and requires further investigation.

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that long-acting injectable antipsychotics are effective in managing schizophrenia spectrum disorders in children and adolescents, but more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings.

Another individual participant data meta-analysis of 5,130 individuals found that LAIs were effective in preventing relapse, with a lower incidence rate in the prospectively determined symptom remission subcohort [6]. A nationwide cohort study of 16,031 continuous LAI treatment episodes found a similar incidence of breakthrough psychosis for both LAIs and oral antipsychotics [4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 135 studies found that second-generation LAIs were associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality [7]. A nationwide cohort study of 29,823 patients found that LAIs were associated with a 33% lower mortality risk compared to equivalent oral agents [8].

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 92 trials with a total of 22,645 participants showed that LAIs were more effective than placebo in preventing relapse, with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and paliperidone identified as the best choices for maintenance treatment [10]. Another meta-analysis of 19 treatment cohorts consisting of 5130 individuals found a lower incidence of relapse among individuals with prospectively determined symptom remission (PSR) compared to those without PSR [4]. Treatment adherence and attitude towards medication were found to be negatively associated with symptom scores [5]. However, some patients may experience breakthrough psychotic symptoms on antipsychotic maintenance medication [7]. A literature review involving children and adolescents reported clinical improvement in most cases, with common side effects including weight gain, tremor, and oculogyric crisis [6]. The use of LAIs in this population is still under-studied and requires further investigation.

"," The efficacy of Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics (LAIs) in managing Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders in children and adolescents is supported by several studies, albeit with varying degrees of evidence. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that LAIs and oral antipsychotics were effective in preventing relapse compared to placebo, with aripiprazole showing moderate confidence levels [5]. Another individual participant data meta-analysis of 5,130 individuals found that LAIs were effective in preventing relapse, with a lower incidence rate in the prospectively determined symptom remission subcohort [6]. A nationwide cohort study of 16,031 continuous LAI treatment episodes found a similar incidence of breakthrough psychosis for both LAIs and oral antipsychotics [4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 135 studies found that second-generation LAIs were associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality [7]. A nationwide cohort study of 29,823 patients found that LAIs were associated with a 33% lower mortality risk compared to equivalent oral agents [8]. However, a literature review of 36 individuals found that while most cases reported clinical improvement, the study design was limited and further research is needed [3].

Oral and intramuscular formulations of first- and second-generation antipsychotics are available, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and haloperidol, as well as long-acting decanoate formulations of haloperidol and fluphenazine. Studies indicate that while all antipsychotics may vary in efficacy, initial dosing of a low dose and titration up may be the best approach as efficacy will differ between patients.

family medicine,child and adolescent mental disorders,"What are the barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking behaviours for common mental health problems in adolescents? A systematic review.","BACKGROUND:
Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap.

METHODS:
Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19âyears. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis.

RESULTS:
Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (nâ=â54) and interventions (nâ=â36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements.

CONCLUSION:
Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments.",Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern.

"," Common barriers to help-seeking behaviors for mental health problems in adolescents include stigma, embarrassment, poor mental health literacy, and preference for self-reliance [2]. Adolescents are more likely to seek help from sources they perceive as approachable, confidential, trustworthy, and knowledgeable about mental health issues [1]. Positive past experiences and social support can facilitate help-seeking [2]. However, interventions such as universal suicide-prevention programs have shown mixed results in promoting help-seeking behaviors in adolescents [3]. Gender also plays a role in help-seeking behaviors, with females more likely to identify psychological problems and have greater awareness of mental health services [5]. Despite these findings, a significant proportion of adolescents who self-harm do not seek help [6]. Interventions targeting help-seeking behaviors have shown short-term benefits in formal help-seeking, self-help, mental health literacy, and personal stigma reduction, but these interventions have not been effective for children, adolescents, or the general public [7]. School-based interventions can improve knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking behaviors related to mental health [8,10]. Parental influence, particularly positive parenting, can increase help-seeking intentions [13,14].

TL;DR: Barriers to help-seeking for mental health issues in adolescents include stigma, poor mental health literacy, and self-reliance, while facilitators include approachability and trustworthiness of help sources, positive past experiences, and social support. Interventions have shown mixed results, with some success in improving mental health literacy and reducing stigma.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown mixed results for depression treatment. The efficacies of tDCS combination therapies have not been investigated deliberately. This review aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of tDCS as a monotherapy and in combination with medication, psychotherapy, and ECT for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and identified the factors influencing treatment outcome measures (i.e. depression score, dropout, response, and remission rates).

METHODS:
The systematic review was performed in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Sciences, and OpenGrey. Two authors performed independent literature screening and data extraction. The primary outcomes were the standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous depression scores after treatment and odds ratio (OR) dropout rate; secondary outcomes included ORs for response and remission rates. Random effects models with 95% confidence intervals were employed in all outcomes. The overall effect of tDCS was investigated by meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were explored via subgroup analyses, meta-regression, sensitivity analyses, and assessment of publication bias.

RESULTS:
Twelve randomised, sham-controlled trials (active group: Nâ=â251, sham group: Nâ=â204) were included. Overall, the integrated depression score of the active group after treatment was significantly lower than that of the sham group (gâ=â-â0.442, pâ=â0.017), and further analysis showed that only tDCS + medication achieved a significant lower scoreÂ (gâ=â-â0.855, p <â0.001). Moreover, this combination achieved a significantly higher response rate than sham intervention (ORâ=â2.7, pâ=â0.006), while the response rate remained unchanged for the other three therapies. Dropout and remission rates were similar in the active and sham groups for each therapy and also for the overall intervention. The meta-regression results showed that current intensity is the only predictor for the response rate. None of publication bias was identified.

CONCLUSION:
The effect size of tDCS treatment was obviously larger in depression score compared with sham stimulation. The tDCS combined selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors is the optimized therapy that is effective on depression score and response rate. tDCS monotherapy and combined psychotherapy have no significant effects. The most important parameter for optimization in future trials is treatment strategy.","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown mixed results for depression treatment.

The most important parameter for optimization in future trials is treatment strategy.," Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), as demonstrated by several studies with varying study designs and sample sizes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized sham-controlled trials involving 289 patients found that active tDCS was significantly superior to sham in terms of response, remission, and depression improvement, with the effect size of tDCS treatment being comparable to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and antidepressant drug treatment in primary care [1]. A pilot study involving 18 patients found that neuroplasticity was increased after tDCS treatment, and there was also significant improvement in mood [2]. A case study of a 66-year-old female patient with recurrent major depressive episodes found a modest improvement in depressive symptoms following tDCS treatment [3]. A study investigating the feasibility and acceptability of using tDCS in combination with computer-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of MDD found a significant improvement in depression from baseline to endpoint [4]. A factorial trial involving 120 antidepressant-free participants found that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism predicted tDCS effects, with long/long homozygotes displaying a larger improvement with active tDCS compared to sham [5]. An interim analysis of technical data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the use of tDCS in MDD found considerable variability in impedance, both inter-individually and intra-individually, but no significant differences between the study center in Munich and the other sites [6]. A study investigating the efficacy of tDCS as a continuation therapy for the maintenance phase of depressive episodes found a survival rate of 73.5% at the end of the 6-month follow-up period [7]. A review of the efficacy and safety of tDCS as a treatment for MDD found that the safety and efficacy profile of tDCS from previous studies supports its use in depression [8]. A study involving 52 patients found that larger gray matter volumes in the left dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) were associated with improvement in depression symptoms in the tDCS group compared to the sham group [9]. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of seven randomized, sham-controlled trials with a total of 478 participants found that tDCS treatment did not enhance cognitive function compared to sham treatment for the 12 cognitive outcomes investigated [10].

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), either alone or in combination with antidepressant medications or psychotherapies, may be an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. However, further large-scale, high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal treatment parameters.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that tDCS can be effective in treating MDD [1,9]. The effect size of tDCS treatment was found to be comparable to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and antidepressant drug treatment in primary care [1]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of individual patient data from ten randomized controlled trials showed that tDCS was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with effect sizes peaking at approximately 6 weeks and continuing to diverge from sham up to 10 weeks [9]. However, a large multicenter randomized controlled trial did not find a significant difference between active tDCS and sham tDCS in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [16]. In addition, a trial comparing tDCS with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, found that tDCS did not show noninferiority to escitalopram in reducing depression symptoms over a 10-week period [17].

It's important to note that this treatment should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.""","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that involves applying a low electrical current to the scalp to modulate brain activity. Several studies have investigated the use of tDCS as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), either alone or in combination with antidepressant medications or psychotherapies.

The effectiveness of tDCS in treating MDD is still a topic of ongoing research and debate. While some studies have shown promising results, the overall evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Some studies have reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms with tDCS, while others have found no significant difference compared to sham stimulation or placebo.

It is important to note that tDCS is considered a relatively safe procedure with minimal side effects. However, the optimal parameters for tDCS, such as the duration, intensity, and electrode placement, are still being investigated. Additionally, the long-term effects and potential risks of tDCS are not yet fully understood.

Given the current state of evidence, it is recommended that tDCS should be used as an adjunctive treatment for MDD, rather than a standalone therapy. It may be considered in cases where standard treatments have been ineffective or poorly tolerated. However, further research is needed to establish its efficacy and determine the optimal protocols for tDCS in the treatment of MDD.","The papers suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), but the evidence is mixed. Wang 2021 found that tDCS combined with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was effective in reducing depression scores and increasing response rates, but tDCS monotherapy and combined psychotherapy did not have significant effects. Oliveira 2021 found that anodic tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex exhibits significant antidepressant effects, comparable to low dose sertraline, and that antidepressant effects can be enhanced by combined treatments, especially tDCS + sertraline. Palm 2012 found that anodal tDCS applied for 2 weeks was not superior to placebo treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression, but secondary outcome measures are pointing to a positive effect of tDCS on emotions. Boggio 2008 found that tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had significantly larger reductions in depression scores compared to occipital and sham tDCS, and the beneficial effects of tDCS in the DLPFC group persisted for 1 month after the end of treatment. Overall, the papers suggest that tDCS, alone or in combination with antidepressant medications, may be effective in treating MDD, but more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy and to address the limitations of the current studies."," Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), as demonstrated by several studies with varying study designs and sample sizes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized sham-controlled trials involving 289 patients found that active tDCS was significantly superior to sham in terms of response, remission, and depression improvement, with the effect size of tDCS treatment being comparable to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and antidepressant drug treatment in primary care [1]. A pilot study involving 18 patients found that neuroplasticity was increased after tDCS treatment, and there was also significant improvement in mood [2]. A case study of a 66-year-old female patient with recurrent major depressive episodes found a modest improvement in depressive symptoms following tDCS treatment [3]. A study investigating the feasibility and acceptability of using tDCS in combination with computer-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of MDD found a significant improvement in depression from baseline to endpoint [4]. A factorial trial involving 120 antidepressant-free participants found that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism predicted tDCS effects, with long/long homozygotes displaying a larger improvement with active tDCS compared to sham [5]. An interim analysis of technical data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the use of tDCS in MDD found considerable variability in impedance, both inter-individually and intra-individually, but no significant differences between the study center in Munich and the other sites [6]. A study investigating the efficacy of tDCS as a continuation therapy for the maintenance phase of depressive episodes found a survival rate of 73.5% at the end of the 6-month follow-up period [7]. A review of the efficacy and safety of tDCS as a treatment for MDD found that the safety and efficacy profile of tDCS from previous studies supports its use in depression [8]. A study involving 52 patients found that larger gray matter volumes in the left dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) were associated with improvement in depression symptoms in the tDCS group compared to the sham group [9]. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of seven randomized, sham-controlled trials with a total of 478 participants found that tDCS treatment did not enhance cognitive function compared to sham treatment for the 12 cognitive outcomes investigated [10].

"," Current evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), either alone or in combination with antidepressant medications or psychotherapies, may be an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. However, further large-scale, high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal treatment parameters.

"," Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been studied as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that tDCS can be effective in treating MDD [1,9]. The effect size of tDCS treatment was found to be comparable to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and antidepressant drug treatment in primary care [1]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of individual patient data from ten randomized controlled trials showed that tDCS was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with effect sizes peaking at approximately 6 weeks and continuing to diverge from sham up to 10 weeks [9]. However, a large multicenter randomized controlled trial did not find a significant difference between active tDCS and sham tDCS in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [16]. In addition, a trial comparing tDCS with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, found that tDCS did not show noninferiority to escitalopram in reducing depression symptoms over a 10-week period [17].

family medicine,depressive disorders,Is there any association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular opportunistic parasite that is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. This parasite accounts for mental disorders; however, the relationship between T. gondii infection and depressive disorder is unclear. Regarding this, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the scientific evidence regarding the potential association between major depression disorder (MDD) and Toxoplasma infection.

METHODS:
For the purpose of the study, the articles related to the subject of interest were systematically searched in seven electronic databases. Special attention was given to the studies examining T. gondii seropositivity level in depressed patients and controls.

RESULTS:
The search process resulted in the identification of a total of 30 publications meeting the inclusion criteria and published up to April 2018 for the systematic review. Furthermore, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria to be entered into meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis involved the review of cross-sectional studies including 1657 depressed patients and 19565 individuals as controls and case-control studies entailing 1311 depressed cases and 6015 controls without depression. 1582 depressed people participated in cross-sectional studies whose results were reported as odds ratio (OR). In addition, the total number of participants was 15068 in this type of studies. Statistical analysis indicated that the pooled OR of the risk of anti-T. gondii IgG antibody in depressed individuals in case-control and cross-sectional studies was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.39).

CONCLUSIONS:
As the findings of the reviewed articles indicated, toxoplasmosis is not a risk factor for MDD. However, it is necessary to perform further research to clarify the detailed association between T. gondii and dysthymia or mild and moderate depression. Furthermore, it is recommended to better investigate the effect of antibody titers on the relationship between depression and T. gondii infection.","Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular opportunistic parasite that is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis.

As the findings of the reviewed articles indicated, toxoplasmosis is not a risk factor for MDD. However, it is necessary to perform further research to clarify the detailed association between T. gondii and dysthymia or mild and moderate depression."," Multiple studies provide evidence suggesting an association between Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection and depression [3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,17,18]. This association is proposed to be due to T. gondii's ability to manipulate the behavior of infected hosts [4], potentially through altering neurotransmitter biosynthesis [4] or triggering immune imbalances [3,13,17]. However, the strength of this association appears to vary among different populations. For instance, some studies found a significant association between T. gondii seropositivity and depression in children and adolescents [7], pregnant women [8,9], and psychiatric patients with a history of suicide attempts [11,14,17]. Conversely, other studies found no significant association between T. gondii infection and postpartum blues in Chinese women [5] or depression in pregnant women in Mexico [12].

","Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and can be transmitted via contaminated food and water, organ transplantation, and vertical transmission. Although infection is asymptomatic in most people, it has the potential to cause severe disease in infants and immunocompromised individuals. Several case reports have suggested an association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and depression, however, additional data is needed to confirm any connection. The incidence of toxoplasmosis infection depends on T. gondii seropositivity in the population. People living in Africa and Europe have higher seropositivity rates than those in the United States, making toxoplasma encephalitis more common in these regions. In the HIV population, Toxoplasma gondii seropositivity is similar to the general population. Therefore, serological testing for Toxoplasma gondii is recommended in HIV infected pregnant women as a precaution.

family medicine,genetic diseases in children,Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem that has major implications for the welfare of the child involved. Unexplained fractures are of particular concern to the orthopaedic surgeon, who must often consider alternative diagnoses to CAN.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
We therefore (1) determined which bone diseases most commonly mimic CAN; (2) what types of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are most commonly confused with CAN and why; and (3) what specific findings in OI and bone disease render a mistaken diagnosis of CAN more likely.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was performed. We identified studies that compared cases of CAN with cases in which patients had bone disease that resulted in an unexplained fracture. We also included studies in which patients with fractures resulting from underlying bony pathology were misclassified as CAN and were subsequently reclassified as bone disease as a result of further investigation. Our search netted only five studies that directly compared and contrasted CAN with metabolic or genetic bone disease in the same study.

RESULTS:
The published literature suggests OI is most frequently confused with CAN, although metaphyseal dysplasia, disorders of phosphate metabolism, and temporary brittle bone disease are also documented in the literature identified by our search. Difficulty in differentiating these bony diseases from CAN stems from ambiguity in the history and physical examination at the time of presentation.

CONCLUSIONS:
Bone disease is a diagnosis of exclusion in the differential diagnosis of CAN.","Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem that has major implications for the welfare of the child involved.

Bone disease is a diagnosis of exclusion in the differential diagnosis of CAN."," Several studies have highlighted the challenges in differentiating between child abuse and bone diseases in cases of unexplained fractures in children [1,5,10,14]. Conditions like vitamin D deficiency rickets and osteogenesis imperfecta have been misdiagnosed as non-accidental injuries [1,5]. Temporary brittle bone disease, characterized by multiple unexplained fractures in infants, has been associated with decreased fetal movement and low bone density, but its existence as a distinct entity remains controversial [2,3,4,6,15]. Furthermore, computed tomography bone density measurements have shown promise in differentiating between intrinsic bone disease and child abuse in atypical cases of osteogenesis imperfecta [8]. However, these findings are based on small sample sizes and case reports, which may limit their generalizability [1,5,6,8,11,13,14].

TL;DR: Unexplained fractures in children can be indicative of both child abuse and certain bone diseases, but more robust research is needed to establish reliable differentiation criteria.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and metabolic bone disease of infancy (MBDI) have been highlighted as potential medical causes of such fractures [2][7][8][11]. Certain characteristics, such as family history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and biochemical findings, can help differentiate OI from NAI [2][7][11]. However, genetic testing is recommended in cases where OI is suspected, but clinical evaluation is inconclusive [7]. MBDI, characterized by poor bone mineralization, has been associated with unexplained fractures, particularly in infants with maternal and infant vitamin D deficiency, decreased fetal bone loading, and prematurity [8][10]. Temporary brittle bone disease (TBBD), another condition associated with unexplained fractures, has been linked to decreased fetal movement and intrauterine confinement [4][14]. However, the existence of TBBD as a distinct condition remains controversial [3][12]. Other conditions, such as congenital syphilis and nutritional deficiencies following maternal bariatric surgery, have also been implicated in cases of unexplained fractures [9][10]. 

TL;DR: While unexplained fractures can be indicative of child abuse, they can also be caused by various bone diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and metabolic bone disease of infancy. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation, including family history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and potentially genetic testing, is necessary to differentiate between these conditions.

In particular, infants with decreased fetal movement, intrauterine confinement, or mothers with prior bariatric surgery are at risk for bone fragility and MBDI [1][5][15][18]. Multiple birth pregnancies also appear to be overrepresented in young infants with fractures [20]. However, other studies emphasize the importance of considering non-accidental injury when a child presents with unexplained fractures [2][3][6]. Specific fracture locations, such as dorsal parts of the chest wall, can be indicative of physical child abuse [2]. Misdiagnosis of bone diseases as child abuse has been reported [7][8][9][16], highlighting the need for careful clinical evaluation, including family history, physical examination, and radiographic findings [4][8][12][13].

Furthermore, computed tomography bone density measurements have shown promise in differentiating between intrinsic bone disease and child abuse in atypical cases of osteogenesis imperfecta [8]. However, these findings are based on small sample sizes and case reports, which may limit their generalizability [1,5,6,8,11,13,14].

"," Unexplained fractures in children can be indicative of both child abuse and certain bone diseases, but more robust research is needed to establish reliable differentiation criteria.

"," Unexplained fractures in children can be indicative of both non-accidental injury (NAI) and various bone diseases, making differential diagnosis challenging [1][2][6][7][12][19]. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and metabolic bone disease of infancy (MBDI) have been highlighted as potential medical causes of such fractures [2][7][8][11]. Certain characteristics, such as family history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and biochemical findings, can help differentiate OI from NAI [2][7][11]. However, genetic testing is recommended in cases where OI is suspected, but clinical evaluation is inconclusive [7]. MBDI, characterized by poor bone mineralization, has been associated with unexplained fractures, particularly in infants with maternal and infant vitamin D deficiency, decreased fetal bone loading, and prematurity [8][10]. Temporary brittle bone disease (TBBD), another condition associated with unexplained fractures, has been linked to decreased fetal movement and intrauterine confinement [4][14]. However, the existence of TBBD as a distinct condition remains controversial [3][12]. Other conditions, such as congenital syphilis and nutritional deficiencies following maternal bariatric surgery, have also been implicated in cases of unexplained fractures [9][10]. 

"," While unexplained fractures can be indicative of child abuse, they can also be caused by various bone diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and metabolic bone disease of infancy. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation, including family history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and potentially genetic testing, is necessary to differentiate between these conditions.

"," The differentiation between child abuse and bone disease in cases of unexplained fractures in children is a complex issue. The literature suggests that various bone diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) [3][4][7][8][10][12][19], metabolic bone disease of infancy (MBDI) [1][5], and temporary brittle bone disease (TBBD) [11][15][17][18], may present with unexplained fractures that can be misinterpreted as non-accidental injury or child abuse. In particular, infants with decreased fetal movement, intrauterine confinement, or mothers with prior bariatric surgery are at risk for bone fragility and MBDI [1][5][15][18]. Multiple birth pregnancies also appear to be overrepresented in young infants with fractures [20]. However, other studies emphasize the importance of considering non-accidental injury when a child presents with unexplained fractures [2][3][6]. Specific fracture locations, such as dorsal parts of the chest wall, can be indicative of physical child abuse [2]. Misdiagnosis of bone diseases as child abuse has been reported [7][8][9][16], highlighting the need for careful clinical evaluation, including family history, physical examination, and radiographic findings [4][8][12][13].

"," While unexplained fractures in children can be indicative of child abuse, they can also be caused by various bone diseases. Therefore, careful clinical evaluation is crucial to differentiate between these conditions.

","Unexplained fractures can indicate a potential for child abuse. Infants and toddlers under the age of 18 months are the most vulnerable to physical abuse and experience the highest percentage of abusive fractures. The most suggestive fractures that can be seen in abusive cases are posterior or lateral rib fractures, corner fractures, sternal fractures, spinal fractures, and scapular fractures. Furthermore, performing a skeletal survey is recommended in cases of suspected physical abuse for children younger than two years old, as studies have found that up to one in four cases of physical abuse involved occult fractures. Therefore, if any unexplained fractures are suspected, a radiologist should be consulted to further aid in the diagnosis.",0.7656654119491577,0.20382165605095542,0.20569022461092218,31.00602876795029,0.07971014492753623,1.0,0.0,0.5138680087560314,0.2625149941220666,0.7796041369438171,0.14193548387096772,0.15936254980079684,30.939874312102344,0.059113300492610835,0.997737556561086,0.0,0.5347497955496822,0.2740489288329057,0.7527841925621033,0.12727272727272726,0.11173888144206147,21.24286308757053,0.04711246200607903,1.0,0.0,0.4645882375669061,0.25711268014377175,0.7536107301712036,0.13541666666666666,0.14560859558311573,24.320608182412826,0.05471698113207547,1.0,0.0,0.4653911883138237,0.25762094029075566,0.7751089930534363,0.13333333333333333,0.17187499999999997,30.903610470413067,0.029197080291970802,0.7606951871657754,0.0,0.5454695373773575,0.2636151103546475,0.7397298216819763,0.12837837837837837,0.0879703881759339,15.684475142322466,0.03296703296703297,1.0,0.0,0.45467286736800755,0.25948620516419163,0.7422237992286682,0.13114754098360656,0.11172432801343976,19.462247349308175,0.040117416829745595,1.0,0.0,0.4556043664189546,0.25978569060637663,0.7923950552940369,0.14035087719298245,0.26335806225365743,37.116169015524996,0.08029197080291971,0.7398190045248869,0.0,0.5672606746940052,0.27757013162036787,0.7361385822296143,0.16961130742049468,0.09052293763666738,19.477217350388642,0.04538087520259319,1.0,0.0,0.4265239610022821,0.25138696875665834,0.7343564033508301,0.184,0.09918509166070538,21.909690075575245,0.04916512059369202,1.0,0.0,0.42372140685717263,0.250430887849095,0.7823817133903503,0.10526315789473684,0.20887728459530028,31.002921090509595,0.040145985401459854,0.7528280542986425,0.0,0.5629411622499808,0.26824018501682556,0.774247944355011,0.19469026548672566,0.17899890041089908,26.6179834665425,0.0863013698630137,1.0,0.0,0.5046563939350407,0.27612868238260285,0.7473196387290955,0.1348314606741573,0.11973575557390587,22.38032881696608,0.05976095617529881,1.0,0.0,0.4861883505227718,0.25312717884688507
family medicine,gynecologic oncology,Adjuvant therapy in early-stage cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy: are we overtreating our patients? A meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
There is a gap in knowledge regarding the ideal management of patients with early-stage cervical cancer and intermediate-risk features. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the published literature on oncological outcomes in these patients and determine trends in postoperative management.

METHODS:
MEDLINE and PubMed were used for literature searches. The inclusion criteria were: English language articles including â¥ 10 patients, patients who underwent radical hysterectomy, nodes negative, studies reporting oncological outcomes and complications treatment-related and compare a surgery-only cohort with a radiotherapy cohort. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Combined relative risk was calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model and a forest plot was drawn.

RESULTS:
We collected 183 manuscripts on early-stage cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy alone or with adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery. A total of eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Regarding oncological outcomes, survival was reported in five studies. The relative risk of recurrence and the relative risk of mortality was similar in both groups independently whether receive or not adjuvant therapy. Most of the studies did not report significant differences regarding morbidity treatment related between the groups, except for a higher rate of lymphedema after radiotherapy.

CONCLUSION:
We found that the relative risk of recurrence and mortality was similar in both groups not depending on adjuvant therapy. Therefore, whether radiotherapy adjuvant treatment is indicated remains a topic of debate.","There is a gap in knowledge regarding the ideal management of patients with early-stage cervical cancer and intermediate-risk features.

Therefore, whether radiotherapy adjuvant treatment is indicated remains a topic of debate."," The use of adjuvant therapy in early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy is explored across multiple studies. The addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation therapy has been shown to improve overall survival rates [1]. However, studies have shown mixed results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that while adjuvant radiotherapy did not significantly improve 5-year survival rates, it did significantly lower the risk of disease progression [2,13]. Similarly, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy was found to significantly reduce the risk of death and disease progression compared to radiotherapy alone in two trials, while another trial found no significant difference [3,6,14]. A retrospective study found that adjuvant lower pelvic radiation is effective for pelvic control in patients with lymph node negative cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy [7]. However, another retrospective study of 861 patients found no survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared to no adjuvant treatment [8]. The risk of serious adverse events appears to be higher with radiation [2,13], while the addition of chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of severe acute toxicity [6,14].

TL;DR: The use of adjuvant therapy, specifically cisplatin-based chemotherapy given concurrently with radiotherapy, could potentially improve survival rates and reduce the risk of disease progression in early-stage cervical cancer patients following radical hysterectomy, but the evidence is mixed and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

","The use of adjuvant therapy after a radical hysterectomy in stage I cervical cancers is associated with a significant reduction in vaginal and pelvic recurrences which may further be diminished, especially in cases of poor differentiation, deep myometrial invasion and extracervical involvement. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been found to improve pelvic recurrences and progression-free survival in advanced primary endometrial cancers and recurrent endometrial cancer. The results of trials investigating the use of adjuvant chemotherapy after definitive chemoradiation have been mixed, with some showing improved progression-free survival but higher associated toxicity and hospitalizations.

family medicine,gynecologic oncology,Does coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> supplementation improve fertility outcomes in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE:
Increased oxidative stress has been identified as a pathogenetic mechanism in female infertility. However, the effect of specific antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), on the outcomes after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the best available evidence regarding the effect of CoQ<sub>10</sub> supplementation on clinical pregnancy (CPR), live birth (LBR), and miscarriage rates (MR) compared with placebo or no-treatment in women with infertility undergoing ART.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane, and Scopus, from inception to March 2020. Data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The I<sup>2</sup> index was employed for heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
Five randomized-controlled trials fulfilled eligibility criteria (449 infertile women; 215 in CoQ<sub>10</sub> group and 234 in placebo/no treatment group). Oral supplementation of CoQ<sub>10</sub> resulted in an increase of CPR when compared with placebo or no-treatment (28.8% vs. 14.1%, respectively; OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.30-4.59, p = 0.006; I<sup>2</sup> 32%). This effect remained significant when women with poor ovarian response and polycystic ovarian syndrome were analyzed separately. No difference between groups was observed regarding LBR (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66-4.25, p = 0.28; I<sup>2</sup> 34%) and MR (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.81, p = 0.52; I<sup>2</sup> 0%).

CONCLUSIONS:
Oral supplementation of CoQ<sub>10</sub> may increase CPR when compared with placebo or no-treatment, in women with infertility undergoing ART procedures, without an effect on LBR or MR.","Increased oxidative stress has been identified as a pathogenetic mechanism in female infertility.

However, further studies are needed to definitively determine the value of CoQ10 supplementation for improving fertility outcomes in women undergoing ART.",0.7548275589942932,0.13986013986013987,0.13361462728551338,34.62745424093189,0.058011049723756904,0.8374494949494949,0.0,0.5413778722286224,0.26176673865880656,0.7431066632270813,0.1032258064516129,0.1512950618512254,30.16343385483052,0.06077348066298342,1.0,0.0,0.5242050421237946,0.25227480517687967,0.7666272521018982,0.11428571428571428,0.08077226162332544,18.460784955020756,0.03853211009174312,1.0,0.0,0.5278477661355198,0.2773887926354636,0.7682808041572571,0.11940298507462686,0.10459460282651074,22.73922873915423,0.04576659038901602,1.0,0.0,0.5357575371003837,0.2801564339371719,0.7680190205574036,0.16260162601626016,0.15740740740740738,37.06191098778826,0.052486187845303865,0.7427886319333687,0.0,0.5828143782534841,0.26659937627329994,0.7652032971382141,0.125,0.09813102511774997,16.979709296191224,0.03460837887067395,1.0,0.0,0.5076256094669754,0.2722978226069919,0.7681437134742737,0.1357142857142857,0.10809563899428655,19.700605426101088,0.04013015184381779,1.0,0.0,0.5155602307012765,0.27476706307079657,0.7384154200553894,0.15517241379310345,0.15261707988980716,33.4980015556442,0.03314917127071823,0.7362626262626263,0.0,0.5384250540624965,0.240599156732223,0.7745026350021362,0.13846153846153847,0.13280388446531324,22.151067750596596,0.061465721040189124,1.0,0.0,0.5356750104137247,0.2837938956858413,0.7746972441673279,0.16289592760180996,0.15546434588733068,24.906849561605593,0.06567164179104477,1.0,0.0,0.5378948401346385,0.28214571951737216,0.7662678956985474,0.1391304347826087,0.2231426692965154,33.95397947827904,0.049723756906077346,0.7139218269653052,0.0,0.5886132608760487,0.2639446253892361,0.7895451188087463,0.1899441340782123,0.19735244864059764,33.241675653279934,0.0924170616113744,1.0,0.0,0.592306099468615,0.29651246467767084,0.7734721302986145,0.11702127659574468,0.13424975077769372,25.752896373652046,0.06016597510373444,1.0,0.0,0.5759472334629869,0.2777768292972588
family medicine,infections and infestations,Is hybrid therapy more efficient in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Hybrid therapy (HT) is a non-bismuth quadruple therapy created to surpass Helicobacter pylori's (H. pylori) resistance rates to antibiotics. HT has excellent eradication rates, as well as a very good compliance and safety profile. We aim to compare HT with sequential therapy (ST) and concomitant therapy (CT) for the eradication of H. pylori.

METHODS:
This systematic review was conducted following the principles of the PRISMA guidelines. Literature was electronically searched on the CENTRAL library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The primary outcome evaluated was eradication rate of H. pylori. The secondary outcomes evaluated were adverse events and compliance rates. Meta-analyses were performed with Cochrane Review Manager 5.4. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate the pooled relative risk and 95% confidence interval of the eradication rates between HT and other regimens, as well as the secondary outcomes.

RESULTS:
10 studies were included, comprising 2993 patients. The mean eradication rates achieved by HT with intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were, respectively, 86% (range: 79.2-90.8%) and 91.7% (range: 82.6-96.1%). No statistically significant difference was found in ITT eradication rate between HT and CT (relative risk: 1; 95% CI: 0.96- 1.03) and between HT and ST (relative risk: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.92-1.14). PP analysis revealed similar results. HT was associated with higher compliance rates than CT and slightly lower than ST. As far as adverse events are concerned, this meta-analysis demonstrated a higher occurrence of adverse events on the group of patients treated with CT when compared with HT. HT and ST showed similar results.

CONCLUSION:
HT has similar eradication, compliance and adverse event rates when compared to ST, but a better safety profile than the CT.","Hybrid therapy (HT) is a non-bismuth quadruple therapy created to surpass Helicobacter pylori's (H. pylori) resistance rates to antibiotics.

HT has similar eradication, compliance and adverse event rates when compared to ST, but a better safety profile than the CT.Th"," The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a significant challenge due to increasing antibiotic resistance [1][2][4][8][12][13]. Among the various therapeutic regimens, hybrid therapy has been extensively studied for its efficacy and safety [3][5][9][10][11][14][15]. A comprehensive review including 1871 patients found that hybrid therapy had similar efficacy, compliance, and safety compared to sequential or concomitant therapy, but might be superior in Asians [3]. A randomized clinical trial suggested that hybrid therapy could be a reasonable first-line treatment option for H. pylori in areas with high antibiotic resistance, as it had better adherence and fewer adverse events compared to concomitant therapy [5]. A network meta-analysis of 68 randomized controlled trials with 22,975 patients found that reverse hybrid therapy achieved cure rates of over 90% [6]. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found no significant differences in eradication rates between hybrid therapy and sequential or concomitant therapy [9][10][14]. However, one study found that reverse hybrid therapy was superior to standard triple therapy [10]. A randomized clinical trial suggested that hybrid therapy, with less antibiotic usage, may be a reasonable first-line treatment choice for H. pylori infection [11]. A systematic review found that the crude H. pylori eradication rate of reverse hybrid therapy was 95.5% and 96.2% by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis, respectively, with compliance of 96% and slightly lower side effect rate than the control group [15].

TL;DR: Hybrid therapy appears to be an effective and safe treatment for H. pylori infection, with similar or superior efficacy to other therapies and high compliance rates, particularly in areas with high antibiotic resistance. However, more randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

A meta-analysis of eight RCTs with 2516 subjects found no significant difference in eradication rates between HT and sequential or concomitant therapy [5]. A network meta-analysis of 68 RCTs with 22,975 patients found that reverse HT achieved cure rates of over 90%, making it one of the most effective regimens [8]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs with 2993 patients found similar eradication rates for HT compared to ST and CT, but a better safety profile for HT than CT [11]. Lastly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of six RCTs found no significant differences in eradication rates between HT, sequential therapy, and concomitant therapy [12].

"," Based on the available evidence, hybrid therapy appears to be an effective treatment for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection, often showing similar or higher eradication rates compared to other therapies. However, the effectiveness may be influenced by factors such as antibiotic resistance and patient compliance.

","Hybrid therapy, which involves a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors, is seen as a more efficient way to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Meta-analyses have found that H. pylori eradication significantly reduces the risk of gastric cancer and superficial gastric neoplasia. Clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and tetracycline are the antibiotics typically used in combination therapy. This treatment has been proven to induce regression in lymphoma and has been successful in H. pylori eradication in up to 75% of patients. A phase 3 clinical trial in children in China found the vaccine effective in preventing H. pylori infection for up to three years. Hybrid therapy thus seems to be more efficient in eradicating H. pylori compared to vaccines.",0.7086337804794312,0.11522633744855966,0.16285211267605634,30.81412454121076,0.05217391304347826,0.759596186833891,0.0,0.4970493584405631,0.2359961673636388,0.7116797566413879,0.10185185185185185,0.15428571428571428,32.32862355707324,0.036231884057971016,0.7748532830301815,0.0,0.5045618900786275,0.2357151611126104,0.770295262336731,0.1493212669683258,0.15966748915985915,25.336559403844433,0.08119079837618404,1.0,0.0,0.5474376250957621,0.2958635367948509,0.7698143720626831,0.15656565656565657,0.15713869501073116,28.68671206415783,0.089540412044374,1.0,0.0,0.5514762341019942,0.2955621081611345,0.7059075832366943,0.07368421052631578,0.2185678679185173,30.26391337154113,0.02463768115942029,0.7871825876662636,0.0,0.5217863403792892,0.22554430823612828,0.7759795188903809,0.1509433962264151,0.1362375033518509,22.091771264271955,0.08100929614873838,1.0,0.0,0.5595848729516741,0.2987756362716369,0.7761958837509155,0.1435185185185185,0.14078611297188962,24.423436736309565,0.0890937019969278,1.0,0.0,0.5656961857221589,0.2981471282747224,0.7046298980712891,0.09523809523809523,0.177482280690685,31.388235983175054,0.02608695652173913,0.7750906892382105,0.0,0.5185507227267537,0.22634556317748036,0.7832450270652771,0.1580135440180587,0.18291592628935097,24.360896500192236,0.08608321377331421,1.0,0.0,0.5847050876040524,0.3009578028433028,0.7852906584739685,0.16624685138539042,0.20034043662951118,27.71111534559467,0.09644670050761421,1.0,0.0,0.5984359867266706,0.3031892665675846,0.7061901092529297,0.09473684210526316,0.2387280551616216,34.0493098858119,0.030434782608695653,0.7843648425279833,0.0,0.503959908348615,0.22572660737897515,0.7227334380149841,0.1037037037037037,0.1676305598212488,31.775749091586764,0.059420289855072465,0.8837003738534318,0.0,0.5316975783828078,0.25003428816771484,0.7046501040458679,0.11320754716981132,0.1587486131656805,31.067076534819616,0.05652173913043478,0.8773364065755578,0.0,0.46979594910210304,0.2371146211661923
family medicine,infections and infestations,Does vitamin D reduce the mortality rate of Plasmodium infection?: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Vitamin D supplementation is recommended as an effective adjunct to counteract malaria pathogenesis, but the evidence on this point is limited and controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D administration on the survival rate of Plasmodium-infected animals in experimentally-induced malaria on days 6 and 10 post-infection.

METHODS:
Five electronic databases were searched up to 20 December 2021. The pooled risks ratio (RR) and associated 95% confidence interval were estimated using the Restricted-maximum likelihood (REML) random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> value. Sub-group analyses were used to identify the sources of heterogeneity for several variables, such as type of vitamin D, type of intervention, and dose of vitamin D.

RESULTS:
Out of 248 articles found in the electronic database, six were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The current study found that the pooled random effect of risks ratio favored a statistically significant effect of vitamin D administration on survival rate in infected mice on day 6 post Plasmodium infection (RRâ=â1.08, 95%CI 1.03, 1.15, pâ<â0.99; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%). It also found that vitamin D administration significantly affected the survival rate on day 10 post-infection (RRâ=â1.94, 95%CI 1.39, 2.71, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â69.02%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant pooled RRs of the positive effect of vitamin D administration for cholecalciferol (RRâ=â3.11, 95%CI 2.41, 4.03, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%), doses higher than 50Â Âµg/kg (RRâ=â3.37, 95%CI 2.55, 4.27, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%), and oral administration (RRâ=â3.01, 95%CI 2.37, 3.82, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%).

CONCLUSION:
This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that vitamin D administration positively affects the survival rate in Plasmodium-infected mice. Since, the mouse model may not accurately reproduce the clinical and pathological features of human malaria, future research should investigate the impact of vitamin D in human malaria.","Vitamin D supplementation is recommended as an effective adjunct to counteract malaria pathogenesis, but the evidence on this point is limited and controversial.

family medicine,infections and infestations,Is It Really the Foley? A Systematic Review of Bladder Management and Infection Risk.,"BACKGROUND:
The belief that intermittent catheterization results in fewer infections than indwelling catheters is commonly expressed in the spinal cord injury literature. Some practice guidelines strongly recommend intermittent over indwelling catheterization due to concerns about infections and other complications. However, studies on this topic are of low quality. Guidelines from the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine suggest the data regarding infection risk are mixed, and they do not recommend one bladder management method over the other.

OBJECTIVES:
To compare risk of bias in studies reporting higher rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) with indwelling catheters to studies that found equal rates of UTI between indwelling and intermittent catheterization, and to describe implications in clinical decision-making.

METHODS:
A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS databases from January 1, 1980, to September 15, 2020, was conducted. Eligible studies compared symptomatic UTI rates between indwelling and intermittent catheterization. We used a risk of bias assessment tool to evaluate each study.

RESULTS:
Twenty-four studies were identified. Only three of these reported significantly higher UTI risk with indwelling catheters, and all three demonstrated a critical risk of bias. More than half of the studies reported differences in UTI risk of less than 20% between the two methods. Studies with larger (nonsignificant) differences favoring intermittent catheterization were more susceptible to bias from confounding.

CONCLUSION:
The hypothesis that indwelling catheters cause more UTIs than intermittent catheterization is not supported by the scientific literature. Most studies failed to demonstrate a significant difference in UTI risk, and studies with nonsignificant trends favoring intermittent catheterization were more susceptible to bias from confounding. Perceived risk of infection should not influence a patient's choice of catheter type.","To compare risk of bias in studies reporting higher rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) with indwelling catheters to studies that found equal rates of UTI between indwelling and intermittent catheterization, and to describe implications in clinical decision-making.","A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS databases from January 1, 1980, to September 15, 2020, was conducted.

Therefore, clean intermittent catheterization is usually preferred over indwelling catheter placement as a way to reduce the risk of infections.",0.7800745368003845,0.20833333333333331,0.2438044123466562,43.60517731189048,0.08024691358024691,0.7802005012531329,0.0,0.6274438711075947,0.2952316421551318,0.7819697260856628,0.14507772020725387,0.29375742503873675,42.372129615332305,0.09465020576131687,0.8572190549634159,0.0,0.607470212903406,0.29804267107573984,0.7773008346557617,0.15294117647058822,0.15267551319161837,28.688982267336392,0.06692160611854685,1.0,0.0,0.5578311067787024,0.29754039307942703,0.7739133834838867,0.16835016835016836,0.17235667419597722,32.04127113277668,0.07611241217798595,1.0,0.0,0.5562128196192893,0.29527804677378666,0.7874343991279602,0.11688311688311688,0.24536679536679534,38.746814931060236,0.03909465020576132,0.7643421741166102,0.0,0.6038215897851071,0.2889922996099492,0.795055627822876,0.16766467065868262,0.173609399473164,30.16643182228466,0.07218683651804671,1.0,0.0,0.576592972696717,0.3068437025748186,0.7959839105606079,0.1727574750830565,0.19488768772656656,33.82174456494092,0.08145363408521303,1.0,0.0,0.5815515097818876,0.30871726479597644,0.7754126787185669,0.1388888888888889,0.25952743902439024,34.89803272459523,0.03497942386831276,0.7781954887218046,0.0,0.621958589553833,0.2830231820049332,0.7966684103012085,0.17582417582417584,0.17839046349754067,28.438108022541854,0.07762938230383973,1.0,0.0,0.5833544211492252,0.31164073651132984,0.7859548926353455,0.16666666666666666,0.17489077526600977,30.814328064672207,0.06935817805383022,1.0,0.0,0.571448340357005,0.3028163326994574,0.8253176808357239,0.22085889570552145,0.41918736341285745,45.526611141625466,0.10699588477366255,0.7293233082706767,0.0,0.680560658685863,0.32304338705610236,0.8091933131217957,0.1777777777777778,0.19550748752079863,41.98332670197396,0.10082304526748971,0.7906565291433713,0.0,0.638845401329379,0.31240397778783136,0.791919469833374,0.18357487922705315,0.24442307692307688,45.15630141990471,0.09876543209876543,0.7552888579674293,0.0,0.6208692801759598,0.300198221569752
family medicine,labor and delivery,Does the Finnish intervention prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries? A systematic review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVES:
A rise in obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) has been observed and a preventive approach, originating in Finland, has been introduced in several European hospitals. The aim of this paper was to systematically evaluate the evidence behind the 'Finnish intervention'.

DESIGN:
A systematic review of the literature conducted according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

OUTCOME MEASURES:
The primary outcome was OASIS. Secondary outcomes were (perinatal): Apgar scores, pH and standard base excess in the umbilical cord, and (maternal): episiotomy, intact perineum, first and second-degree perineal lacerations, duration of second stage, birth position and women's perceptions/birth experiences.

METHODS:
Multiple databases (Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed and SveMed) were systematically searched for studies published up to December 2014. Both randomised controlled trials and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if a full-text article was not available. Studies were evaluated by use of international reporting guidelines (eg, STROBE).

RESULTS:
Overall, 1042 articles were screened and 65 retrieved for full-text evaluation. Seven studies, all observational and with a level of evidence at 2c or lower, were included and consistently reported a significant reduction in OASIS. All evaluated episiotomy and found a significant increase. Three studies evaluated perinatal outcomes and reported conflicting results. No study reported on other perineal outcomes, duration of the second stage, birth positions or women's perceptions.

CONCLUSIONS:
A reduction in OASIS has been contributed to the Finnish intervention in seven observational studies, all with a low level of evidence. Knowledge about the potential perinatal and maternal side effects and women's perceptions of the intervention is extremely limited and the biological mechanisms underlying the Finnish intervention are not well documented. Studies with a high level of evidence are needed to assess the effects of the intervention before implementation in clinical settings can be recommended.","A rise in obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) has been observed and a preventive approach, originating in Finland, has been introduced in several European hospitals.

A study conducted in a Danish hospital found no significant decrease in OASIS after the implementation of the Finnish intervention, but it did observe increased episiotomy rates, longer second stage of labor, and decreased use of upright birth positions [2]. However, a comparison between two university hospitals in Sweden and Finland found a lower incidence of anal sphincter ruptures in Finland, where the Finnish intervention is commonly used [4]. This study also observed that the risk for anal sphincter ruptures was estimated to be 13 times higher in Sweden compared to Finland, excluding high-risk deliveries [4]. However, all these studies have potential biases, such as self-reported data, retrospective design, and lack of control groups, which may affect the reliability of their findings [1][2][4].

TL;DR: The evidence is mixed and potentially biased, but it suggests that the Finnish intervention may not significantly decrease the incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries, and it might increase episiotomy rates and the duration of the second stage of labor.

family medicine,laboratory medicine,Is chorioamnionitis associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants? A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA.,"BACKGROUND:
The relationships between chorioamnionitis (CA) and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants remain controversial. The meta-analysis aims to evaluate the associations between CA and neurodevelopmental deficits in preterm infants.

METHODS:
All studies exploring the associations between CA and neurodevelopmental deficits in preterm infants were retrieved from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, OVID, EBSCO, ProQuest, CDSR, and CENTRAL. The NOS was used to evaluate the quality of the studies, RevMan was adopted to analyze the data.

RESULTS:
Twelve studies involving 4267 preterm infants were included. The ORs across studies was 0.95 (Pâ=â.77, Iâ=â51%) for cognitive deficits, 1.09 (Pâ=â.44, Iâ=â10%) for psychomotor deficits, 1.21 (Pâ=â.08, Iâ=â25%) for language deficits, 2.34 (Pâ=â.02, Iâ=â0%) for performance intelligence quotient impairment and 2.81 (Pâ=â.03, Iâ=â0%) for verbal intelligence quotient impairment. Subgroup analyses based on the severity of cognitive deficits indicated that CA might be correlated with severe cognitive deficits (Pâ=â.01, Iâ=â0%) but not with mild cognitive deficits (Pâ=â.40, Iâ=â19%). In terms of the CA category, clinical CA may be related to overall psychomotor deficits (Pâ=â.01, Iâ=â25%) and overall language deficits (Pâ<â.00001, Iâ=â23%) other than histological CA.

CONCLUSION:
In preterm infants, CA might be a risk factor for performance and verbal intelligence quotient impairment and severe cognitive deficits, and clinical CA might be a risk factor for overall psychomotor and language deficits.",The relationships between chorioamnionitis (CA) and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants remain controversial.

Similarly, a meta-analysis of 18 studies with 13,755 very preterm/very low-birth-weight infants found no significant effect of chorioamnionitis on mental or motor development [5]. A study of 197 very low birth weight and very low gestational age infants found no associations between histological or clinical chorioamnionitis and neurodevelopmental impairments at 2 years of age, but did find an association between histological chorioamnionitis and slightly poorer cognitive outcome and weaker memory and learning functions at 5 years of age [10]. A retrospective cohort study with 384 preterm infants found that histological chorioamnionitis was associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy but not total major disabilities [12]. Finally, a retrospective study of 985 infants found that children with chorioamnionitis did not have lower scores on cognitive, behavioral, or academic assessments at any age [14].

TL;DR: The evidence on the association between chorioamnionitis and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants is mixed, with some studies finding an association and others not. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship.

","Chorioamnionitis is associated with a range of neonatal complications, the most significant being preterm birth, cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, neurologic abnormalities, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal sepsis, listeriosis, and neonatal death. Of particular note, it is associated with very low birth weight and long-term impairments in brain development in preterm infants, as well as increased risk of cesarean section, endometritis, postpartum hemorrhage, bacteremia, and sepsis in the mother.

family medicine,laboratory medicine,Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Many studies have investigated whether pleural cholesterol levels can aid in diagnosis of pleural exudates, and the results have varied considerably. To gain a more reliable answer to this question, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol or the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) as diagnostic tests to help identify pleural exudates.

METHODS:
Literature databases were systematically searched for studies examining accuracy of pleural cholesterol or P/S cholesterol ratios for diagnosing pleural exudates. Data on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using bivariate-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to summarize overall test performance.

RESULTS:
Our meta-analysis included up to 20 studies involving 3,496 subjects. Summary estimates for pleural cholesterol in the diagnosis of pleural exudates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.88 (95%CI 0.84 to 0.92); specificity, 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98); PLR, 20.31 (95% CI 11.21 to 36.78); NLR, 0.12 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.17); DOR, 167.06 (95% CI 76.79 to 363.95); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98). The corresponding summary performance estimates for using the P/S cholesterol ratio were as follows: sensitivity, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96); specificity, 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.91); PLR 7.46 (95% CI, 5.47 to 10.19); NLR, 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.10); DOR, 107.74 (95% CI 60.91 to 190.60); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98).

CONCLUSIONS:
Both pleural cholesterol level and the P/S cholesterol ratio are helpful for the diagnosis of pleural exudates. Nevertheless, the results of pleural cholesterol assays should be interpreted in parallel with the results of traditional tests and clinical information.","Many studies have investigated whether pleural cholesterol levels can aid in diagnosis of pleural exudates, and the results have varied considerably.

Nevertheless, the results of pleural cholesterol assays should be interpreted in parallel with the results of traditional tests and clinical information."," The use of cholesterol to distinguish between pleural exudates and transudates has been explored in multiple studies. Several studies found that pleural fluid cholesterol levels can be used as an effective marker to differentiate between transudates and exudates [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. For instance, a study including 255 patients with pleural effusions found that combining pleural fluid cholesterol level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level yielded higher specificity and accuracy than using Light's criteria alone [5]. Another study with 93 pleural fluid and serum specimens found the efficiency of cholesterol concentration in detecting exudates to be 77% [6]. Similarly, a study of 381 patients found that the pleural fluid to serum albumin ratio was the most accurate parameter for distinguishing between exudates and transudates, but suggested that different alternatives, including cholesterol, could be used instead of Light's criteria [7]. However, a study of 500 pleural effusions found that Light's criteria remain the best method for distinguishing exudates from transudates, with cholesterol concentration yielding lower accuracy [8]. A study of 180 patients found that a cholesterol level over 45 mg/dL and/or LDH over 200 IU/L identified exudates with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 98% [9]. Lastly, a study of 60 patients found that using a cut-off point of greater than 60 mg/dL for cholesterol and/or greater than 3 g/dL for total protein, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were all 100% [10].

TL;DR: Pleural fluid cholesterol levels can be an effective marker to differentiate between pleural exudates and transudates, often in combination with other parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, although Light's criteria remain a highly accurate method.

","Cholesterol levels can be used to help differentiate between transudative and exudative pleural effusions. Light’s criteria, which include pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, can be used to distinguish between the two types of effusions. Additionally, serum to fluid protein gradient of greater than 3.1 and a serum to fluid albumin gradient of greater than 1.2 may indicate a transudative effusion.

family medicine,pediatric oncology,Do statins play any role in reducing the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between statin consumption and risk of incidence of ovarian cancer (OC) and associated mortality.

METHODS:
Computerized searches were conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus). Two calibrated authors performed the publications selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of the selected publications. The quality of the included articles was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies, and Jadad criteria for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The electronic searches retrieved 2272 titles/abstracts. After the deletion of duplicate publications, 2030 titles/abstracts were assessed. Eighteen articles were included.

RESULTS:
Meta-analysis demonstrated that risk ratio (RR) of the association between statin consumption and OC incidence was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.75-1.03, P = 0.109). Patients receiving statin were less likely to die than those who did not receive statin, with a statistically significant association [RR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, P = 0.0001)]. There was no evidence of publication bias in examining the association between statin consumption and the risk of incidence and mortality from OC.

Statin use reduces the incidence risk of OC and significantly increased the survival in OC patients."," The role of statins in reducing the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer remains inconclusive. A meta-analysis of 19 studies found no significant reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer with statin use [1]. An umbrella review of meta-analyses found suggestive evidence for reduced all-cause mortality in ovarian cancer with statin use, but overall, the evidence supporting the use of statins to reduce cancer mortality was low [2]. A systematic review suggested improved survival in statin users among women with ovarian cancer, but it also highlighted the risk of immortal time bias [3]. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis found that genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition (target of statins) was associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer [10]. However, a retrospective cohort study found that post-diagnostic statin use was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause or ovarian cancer-specific mortality [11]. Another retrospective cohort study found that statin use after ovarian cancer diagnosis was associated with better ovarian cancer-specific survival [12]. 

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that statins may have a role in improving survival in women with ovarian cancer, but the evidence is not strong enough to definitively state that statins reduce the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer. More research, particularly randomized controlled trials, is needed to further investigate the potential benefits of statins in ovarian cancer.

","No, statins do not have any role in reducing the incidence or mortality of ovarian cancer. The current evidence shows that a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) at the time of hysterectomy may be beneficial in reducing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. There is also evidence that certain genes such as KRAS, PI3K, PTEN and ARID1A may be involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, studies have found antiangiogenic agents to be effective in treating recurrent ovarian cancer, while chemotherapy regimens of BEP or TC can be used in treating stage I disease. For platinum-resistant cases, novel treatments such as targeting tumor vasculature, DNA repair and intracellular signaling may be effective.",0.7663014531135559,0.11347517730496455,0.10874313171023292,16.889277842879018,0.030837004405286344,1.0,0.0,0.46913055301636686,0.25721392722639547,0.7810758948326111,0.13793103448275865,0.1490870240870241,22.50368958347452,0.04748603351955307,1.0,0.0,0.4960354890638185,0.270378851104935,0.7638998627662659,0.09090909090909091,0.06446895781758168,11.095840238071473,0.025150905432595575,1.0,0.0,0.4761689654712019,0.2739548426703752,0.7702232599258423,0.10679611650485438,0.07042253521126761,14.166378858419234,0.0340599455040872,1.0,0.0,0.4867607056478824,0.2783839824206166,0.7941509485244751,0.10869565217391304,0.2074029057606422,26.369009839599027,0.06722689075630252,1.0,0.0,0.5305840058459176,0.28495591911731344,0.7585797905921936,0.08955223880597016,0.05466980392156863,10.807772290324499,0.024324324324324326,1.0,0.0,0.4468417156859107,0.26678717934307306,0.7627497911453247,0.10300429184549355,0.06391930307198534,12.652606369096416,0.02854122621564482,1.0,0.0,0.4560132990280787,0.2712534612861963,0.7830526232719421,0.14492753623188404,0.16129032258064516,26.206117747881713,0.06666666666666667,0.8531914893617021,0.0,0.5067865884885555,0.266468982833391,0.7626835107803345,0.0784313725490196,0.05830026761986291,9.392846006520433,0.02365415986949429,1.0,0.0,0.46033130439482334,0.27269183108068124,0.7652060389518738,0.08461538461538462,0.06188109399005187,10.952612930789059,0.0273972602739726,1.0,0.0,0.464815574279055,0.27546766401541256,0.7867814898490906,0.125,0.20364076028138528,28.75513668110978,0.07142857142857142,0.9372340425531915,0.0,0.5257846643882138,0.27631006565119265,0.8011395335197449,0.2057142857142857,0.10585269552012153,17.423927536808804,0.05789473684210526,1.0,0.0,0.5246773573259512,0.29849442665464954,0.7588182091712952,0.09333333333333332,0.0995653226400598,15.452462568214495,0.030120481927710843,1.0,0.0,0.453105483494119,0.2559974075905237
family medicine,pregnancy complications,Is there a maternal blood biomarker that can predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labour onset? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
The ability to predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) prior to labour onset is a challenge, and it is currently unclear which biomarker(s), may be potentially predictive of sPTB, and whether their predictive power has any utility. A systematic review was conducted to identify maternal blood biomarkers of sPTB.

METHODS:
This study was conducted according to PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus) were searched up to September 2021 using search terms: ""preterm labor"", ""biomarker"" and ""blood OR serum OR plasma"". Studies assessing blood biomarkers prior to labour onset against the outcome sPTB were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed based on the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Increased odds of sPTB associated with maternal blood biomarkers, as reported by odds ratios (OR), or predictive scores were synthesized. This review was not prospectively registered.

RESULTS:
Seventy-seven primary research articles met the inclusion criteria, reporting 278 unique markers significantly associated with and/or predictive of sPTB in at least one study. The most frequently investigated biomarkers were those measured during maternal serum screen tests for aneuploidy, or inflammatory cytokines, though no single biomarker was clearly predictive of sPTB based on the synthesized evidence. Immune and signaling pathways were enriched within the set of biomarkers and both at the level of protein and gene expression.

CONCLUSION:
There is currently no known predictive biomarker for sPTB. Inflammatory and immune biomarkers show promise, but positive reporting bias limits the utility of results. The biomarkers identified may be more predictive in multi-marker models instead of as single predictors. Omics-style studies provide promising avenues for the identification of novel (and multiple) biomarkers. This will require larger studies with adequate power, with consideration of gestational age and the heterogeneity of sPTB to identify a set of biomarkers predictive of sPTB.","The ability to predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) prior to labour onset is a challenge, and it is currently unclear which biomarker(s), may be potentially predictive of sPTB, and whether their predictive power has any utility.

A cross-sectional study found that lipid metabolites in maternal plasma were associated with increased risk for SPTB [2]. A retrospective case-control study identified 51 metabolites that could differentiate between preterm and term delivery groups [3]. A prospective cohort study identified 25 RNA transcripts associated with an increased risk of SPTB [4]. An epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis identified 45 DNAm loci in maternal blood significantly associated with early SPTB [5]. A retrospective analysis found that both low and high Î²-hCG levels in the second trimester were associated with increased risks of SPTB [6]. A systematic review found that cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 had the highest strength of association with SPTB [7]. Another study found that two long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were differentially expressed between SPTB and term births [8]. A longitudinal multi-omics study suggested that changes in gene expression preceding preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes are consistent across time points and cohorts [10]. A longitudinal study found that coordinated alterations in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome were observed 2 to 4 weeks before delivery [11]. Another retrospective study found that plasma IL-6 and C3a levels, along with cervical dilatation, showed improved predictability for SPTB [12]. RNA sequencing identified significant differences in gene expression in peripheral monocytes and whole blood of women in active SPTB compared to pregnant women of the same gestational age not undergoing labor [13]. Another study found that PLT count, PLT/WBC, and CRP were significantly increased in the HCA group compared to the non-HCA group [14]. Finally, a case-control study identified a genome-wide significant SNP (rs14675645) associated with SPTB [16].

TL;DR: There is evidence to suggest that maternal blood biomarkers, including lipid metabolites, RNA transcripts, DNA methylation loci, Î²-hCG levels, cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, long non-coding RNAs, gene expression changes, IL-6 and C3a levels, PLT count, PLT/WBC, CRP, and a genome-wide significant SNP, may predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and develop reliable prediction models.

One study suggests that the epigenetic signature at specific genetic loci in a mother's blood could serve as a potential biomarker for sPTB [1]. A longitudinal study identified coordinated changes in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome 2 to 4 weeks before delivery, suggesting a molecular shift from pregnancy maintenance to prelabor biology [2]. Lipidomic profiling of plasma samples from pregnant women revealed several lipid metabolites associated with increased risk for sPTB [4]. A systematic review identified cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as biomarkers with good diagnostic accuracy in identifying pregnancies at risk of SPTB [6]. Another study found that maternal peripheral blood platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PLT/WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts could serve as potential biomarkers for HCA-related sPTB [7]. A nested case-control study found that maternal blood early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) gene-based microRNA (miRNA) transcripts could predict the risk of sPTB in the third trimester [14]. Another study found that early pregnancy serum neopterin concentrations (EPSN) can predict SPB in asymptomatic pregnant women [16]. Lastly, a prospective cohort study identified 25 transcripts associated with an increased risk of sPTB and a unique set of 39 genes in cases of very early sPTB [21].

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that several maternal blood biomarkers, including epigenetic signatures, lipid metabolites, specific proteins, miRNA transcripts, and cell-free RNA profiles, may have potential in predicting spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and establish their clinical utility.

A secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial suggested that a proteomic biomarker risk predictor may be useful in predicting spontaneous preterm birth, particularly when dating uncertainty is minimized [3]. A study using a transcriptomic dataset found significant correlations between labor-specific transcriptomic changes in the maternal circulation and those detected in the chorioamniotic membranes, myometrium, and cervix of women at term [4].

A retrospective analysis of a Down screening project database found that both low and high Î²-hCG levels were associated with increased risks of spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth [7]. A case-control study identified a genome-wide significant SNP associated with spontaneous preterm birth [8]. A systematic review of 77 primary research articles found no single biomarker clearly predictive of spontaneous preterm birth, but inflammatory and immune biomarkers showed promise [10]. Lastly, a case-control study nested within a prospective cohort found a significant association between high maternal matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentration and spontaneous preterm birth [11].

TL;DR: While no single maternal blood biomarker has been definitively identified as a predictor of spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset, several studies suggest that biomarkers related to steroid hormone metabolites, interleukin-1 receptor type 4, whole-blood gene expression, proteomic biomarkers, transcriptomic changes, gene expression differences, specific transcripts, Î²-hCG levels, SNPs, and MMP-9 concentration may have predictive value. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and determine their clinical utility.

These include fetal fibronectin, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and Progesterone-related biomarkers. However, the predictive accuracy of these biomarkers varies and none are currently used routinely in clinical practice due to limitations in their predictive accuracy and the need for further research.","Yes, there are several maternal blood biomarkers that have been studied for their potential to predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset. Some of these biomarkers include fetal fibronectin (fFN), placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1), and various inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, it is important to note that while these biomarkers show promise, none of them have been definitively established as a reliable predictor of spontaneous preterm birth. Further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and determine their clinical utility.","Based on the four papers, there is evidence that some maternal blood biomarkers may be associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), but there is no single biomarker that can predict sPTB prior to labor onset. Hornaday (2022) conducted a systematic review of 77 primary research articles and found that no single biomarker was clearly predictive of sPTB. However, immune and signaling pathways were enriched within the set of biomarkers investigated. Kramer (2010) found that high maternal matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentration was significantly associated with sPTB, but none of the other cytokines or C-reactive protein (CRP) were. Lucaroni (2018) identified cervical fetal fibronectin, alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as biomarkers that can have an overall good diagnostic accuracy in identifying pregnancies at risk of sPTB. Liong (2015) investigated cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) biomarkers and found that a combination of CVF biomarkers had a higher predictive value for sPTB than fetal fibronectin alone."," Several studies have identified potential maternal blood biomarkers that may predict spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) prior to labor onset. A cross-sectional study found that lipid metabolites in maternal plasma were associated with increased risk for SPTB [2]. A retrospective case-control study identified 51 metabolites that could differentiate between preterm and term delivery groups [3]. A prospective cohort study identified 25 RNA transcripts associated with an increased risk of SPTB [4]. An epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis identified 45 DNAm loci in maternal blood significantly associated with early SPTB [5]. A retrospective analysis found that both low and high Î²-hCG levels in the second trimester were associated with increased risks of SPTB [6]. A systematic review found that cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 had the highest strength of association with SPTB [7]. Another study found that two long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were differentially expressed between SPTB and term births [8]. A longitudinal multi-omics study suggested that changes in gene expression preceding preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes are consistent across time points and cohorts [10]. A longitudinal study found that coordinated alterations in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome were observed 2 to 4 weeks before delivery [11]. Another retrospective study found that plasma IL-6 and C3a levels, along with cervical dilatation, showed improved predictability for SPTB [12]. RNA sequencing identified significant differences in gene expression in peripheral monocytes and whole blood of women in active SPTB compared to pregnant women of the same gestational age not undergoing labor [13]. Another study found that PLT count, PLT/WBC, and CRP were significantly increased in the HCA group compared to the non-HCA group [14]. Finally, a case-control study identified a genome-wide significant SNP (rs14675645) associated with SPTB [16].

"," There is evidence to suggest that maternal blood biomarkers, including lipid metabolites, RNA transcripts, DNA methylation loci, Î²-hCG levels, cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, long non-coding RNAs, gene expression changes, IL-6 and C3a levels, PLT count, PLT/WBC, CRP, and a genome-wide significant SNP, may predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and develop reliable prediction models.

"," Several studies have explored the potential of maternal blood biomarkers in predicting spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) prior to labor onset. One study suggests that the epigenetic signature at specific genetic loci in a mother's blood could serve as a potential biomarker for sPTB [1]. A longitudinal study identified coordinated changes in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome 2 to 4 weeks before delivery, suggesting a molecular shift from pregnancy maintenance to prelabor biology [2]. Lipidomic profiling of plasma samples from pregnant women revealed several lipid metabolites associated with increased risk for sPTB [4]. A systematic review identified cervical fibronectin, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as biomarkers with good diagnostic accuracy in identifying pregnancies at risk of SPTB [6]. Another study found that maternal peripheral blood platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PLT/WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts could serve as potential biomarkers for HCA-related sPTB [7]. A nested case-control study found that maternal blood early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) gene-based microRNA (miRNA) transcripts could predict the risk of sPTB in the third trimester [14]. Another study found that early pregnancy serum neopterin concentrations (EPSN) can predict SPB in asymptomatic pregnant women [16]. Lastly, a prospective cohort study identified 25 transcripts associated with an increased risk of sPTB and a unique set of 39 genes in cases of very early sPTB [21].

"," Current evidence suggests that several maternal blood biomarkers, including epigenetic signatures, lipid metabolites, specific proteins, miRNA transcripts, and cell-free RNA profiles, may have potential in predicting spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and establish their clinical utility.

"," Multiple studies have aimed to identify maternal blood biomarkers that can predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labor onset, with varying levels of success. A longitudinal study in 63 women identified specific biomarkers, including steroid hormone metabolites and interleukin-1 receptor type 4, that preceded labor [1]. Another longitudinal multi-omics study found that whole-blood gene expression can predict gestational ages and delivery dates in both normal pregnancies and those with spontaneous preterm birth [2]. A secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial suggested that a proteomic biomarker risk predictor may be useful in predicting spontaneous preterm birth, particularly when dating uncertainty is minimized [3]. A study using a transcriptomic dataset found significant correlations between labor-specific transcriptomic changes in the maternal circulation and those detected in the chorioamniotic membranes, myometrium, and cervix of women at term [4]. RNA sequencing on whole blood and peripheral monocytes identified significant differences in gene expression between women undergoing preterm labor and healthy pregnant controls [5]. A prospective cohort study identified 25 transcripts associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth [6]. A retrospective analysis of a Down screening project database found that both low and high Î²-hCG levels were associated with increased risks of spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth [7].

","No, there is not a specific maternal blood biomarker that can predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labour onset. Cervical cerclages and progesterone supplementation are common methods used to help prevent preterm birth, however their efficacy varies based on the indication for cerclage. Fetal fibronectin testing is one possible laboratory tool used to assess the risk of preterm labor, however it is not very sensitive. Finally, a rectovaginal group B streptococcal culture, urine culture, urine drug screen, and tests for sexually transmitted infections may be beneficial in helping to assess the risk of preterm labor.",0.782218337059021,0.12716763005780346,0.1655481757284079,33.93849164809068,0.07560975609756097,0.8709090909090909,0.0,0.5352387091943196,0.2783017125517084,0.7923606634140015,0.1496598639455782,0.20999174690508934,36.59156518759854,0.06647398843930635,0.739124939231891,0.0,0.5590137103572488,0.28074749406818583,0.7573152780532837,0.08260869565217391,0.06539081027667984,12.316017231678526,0.022598870056497175,1.0,0.0,0.49049037192382067,0.27307058684271185,0.7610757946968079,0.0994764397905759,0.07464002983571134,14.20518520873227,0.025179856115107913,1.0,0.0,0.49614811589106406,0.274898508369424,0.7620314359664917,0.07643312101910828,0.10123734533183353,28.19749893086547,0.04189944134078212,0.7994155844155845,0.0,0.49094366033871967,0.258164002124448,0.7747258543968201,0.110803324099723,0.09724757262453411,16.7652305587838,0.03840245775729647,1.0,0.0,0.5068629541958886,0.27984504282439865,0.7751932144165039,0.12861736334405144,0.10626168895905658,19.220405017309975,0.04331450094161959,1.0,0.0,0.5118757229712274,0.27945450559051105,0.7829428315162659,0.06201550387596899,0.12668918918918917,30.16068341900977,0.03468208092485549,0.7626704545454546,0.0,0.5466032415628433,0.27289486934802737,0.7537891268730164,0.08200455580865604,0.08161179217228431,14.13326672646072,0.034782608695652174,1.0,0.0,0.47808045230659785,0.2691328032940577,0.7613550424575806,0.09366391184573003,0.11537172246269815,17.072282002195927,0.04054054054054054,1.0,0.0,0.48714561982667826,0.2730176498510147,0.7899430990219116,0.11612903225806452,0.1362559241706161,33.40609304603447,0.06069364161849711,0.8537373737373737,0.0,0.5416110749004268,0.27971560614768604,0.8061701059341431,0.17721518987341772,0.1741246160952327,27.299693459155318,0.08683473389355742,1.0,0.0,0.5688470792864623,0.30374158516909155,0.7733108401298523,0.125,0.13860889959000103,27.686818814442393,0.05502392344497608,0.8563636363636363,0.0,0.5224755949833814,0.2688263808154623
family medicine,pregnancy complications,Recurrent pregnancy loss: fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception? a meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To compare the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in products of conception (POCs) between recurrent pregnancy loss and sporadic pregnancy loss.

METHODS:
A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases from inception to December 31, 2020. Relevant studies analysing the association between the number of pregnancy losses and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities were included. Independent data extraction was conducted and study quality was assessed. Meta-analyses were carried out to calculate odds ratios by using fixed- or random-effects models according to statistical homogeneity.

RESULTS:
A total of 8320 POCs in 19 studies were identified for the meta-analyses. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss was significantly higher than that in recurrent pregnancy loss. In subgroup analyses, the following studies reported a high incidence of abnormal outcomes of sporadic pregnancy loss: studies withââ¥â300 samples, studies published before 2014, studies conducted in European and American countries, and studies with analyses using conventional karyotype techniques. Moreover, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in women with two pregnancy losses was significantly higher than that in women with three or more pregnancy losses. However, there was no difference in the distribution of abnormal types between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss or between two and three or more pregnancy losses.

The prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in POCs is lower in recurrent pregnancy loss than in sporadic pregnancy loss, and decreased with an increasing number of pregnancy losses."," Chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception (POCs) from miscarriage cases are common, with the rate of occurrence varying between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. In a large-scale study analyzing 24,900 POCs, significant chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 55.8% of the samples, with autosomal trisomies being the most common abnormality [4]. Another study found chromosomal abnormalities in 57.52% of 1556 POCs, with differences in the incidence and distribution of these abnormalities between sporadic abortion (SA) and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) groups [1]. A retrospective cohort study of 43 RPL patients found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the RPL group compared to sporadic losses in women over 35 years [3]. However, another study analyzing 1,102 POCs found no significant difference in aneuploid rates between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss, except for a higher rate of sex chromosome abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss [5]. In contrast, a study of 1,010 miscarriage specimens found a higher frequency of chromosomal variants in the SA group, particularly in cases where maternal age was â¥ 35 years [2].

TL;DR: The evidence suggests there is a high rate of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception from both sporadic and recurrent pregnancy losses, with some studies indicating a higher rate in sporadic losses, particularly in older women [2][3][5]. However, the findings are not consistent across all studies [1][4].

Another study (n=1,102) found a similar rate of chromosomal aneuploidy in both types of losses, except for higher rates of sex chromosome abnormalities in sporadic losses [12]. A third study (n=1,010) found a higher frequency of chromosomal variants in the sporadic abortion group, particularly in women aged â¥35 years, compared to the recurrent miscarriage group [8]. A study comparing rates of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception found higher rates in sporadic compared to recurrent pregnancy loss, especially in women under 30 [3]. However, a meta-analysis of 55 studies found no significant difference in chromosomal abnormalities between sporadic and recurrent losses [11].

Several studies and reviews suggest that chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of both recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. A large retrospective cohort study with 2383 cases found that 56.9% of RPL cases had causative chromosomal abnormalities, with numerical abnormalities being the most common [3]. Another retrospective cohort study involving 1,102 women found no significant difference in aneuploid rates between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss, except for sex chromosome abnormalities being higher in sporadic pregnancy loss [5]. A meta-analysis of 55 studies found no significant difference in the percentage of detected chromosomal abnormalities between women with sporadic pregnancy loss and those with RPL [6]. Another study with a large sample size of 24,900 POC samples found clinically significant abnormalities in 55.8% of samples [11]. A retrospective cohort study involving 43 RPL patients found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC in the RPL group compared to sporadic losses [13]. However, a meta-analysis of 19 studies with 8320 POCs found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss compared to RPL [19]. A cross-sectional study analyzing 1556 POCs found significant differences in the incidence and distribution of chromosomal abnormalities between the SA and RPL groups [20]. 

TL;DR: The current evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that there are fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception in recurrent pregnancy loss compared to sporadic pregnancy loss. The incidence and distribution of chromosomal abnormalities appear to vary between these two groups, but the direction and magnitude of these differences are inconsistent across studies.

In fact, chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of both recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss. Studies have shown that chromosomal abnormalities can be found in approximately 50-60% of miscarriages in the first trimester, regardless of whether the miscarriage is a one-time event or part of a recurrent pattern.""",There is no definitive evidence to suggest that there are fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception in recurrent pregnancy loss compared to sporadic pregnancy loss. Chromosomal abnormalities can occur in both recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss cases. The frequency and types of chromosomal abnormalities can vary among individuals and may be influenced by various factors such as maternal age and genetic predisposition. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management in cases of recurrent or sporadic pregnancy loss.,"The papers suggest that there may be fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception (POCs) in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) compared to sporadic pregnancy loss (SA). Lei 2022 found that the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in POCs was lower in RPL than in SA, and decreased with an increasing number of pregnancy losses. Nikitina 2016 also found that the frequency of embryos with abnormal karyotypes was significantly higher in SA compared to RPL. However, Maslow 2015 found that SNP microarray testing of POCs is a valuable tool for the evaluation of RPL in patients without prior fetal cytogenetic results, and Tharapel 1985 suggests that parents with two or more idiopathic pregnancy losses should be karyotyped to aid in management and counseling."," Chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception (POCs) from miscarriage cases are common, with the rate of occurrence varying between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. In a large-scale study analyzing 24,900 POCs, significant chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 55.8% of the samples, with autosomal trisomies being the most common abnormality [4]. Another study found chromosomal abnormalities in 57.52% of 1556 POCs, with differences in the incidence and distribution of these abnormalities between sporadic abortion (SA) and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) groups [1]. A retrospective cohort study of 43 RPL patients found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the RPL group compared to sporadic losses in women over 35 years [3]. However, another study analyzing 1,102 POCs found no significant difference in aneuploid rates between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss, except for a higher rate of sex chromosome abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss [5]. In contrast, a study of 1,010 miscarriage specimens found a higher frequency of chromosomal variants in the SA group, particularly in cases where maternal age was â¥ 35 years [2].

"," The evidence suggests there is a high rate of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception from both sporadic and recurrent pregnancy losses, with some studies indicating a higher rate in sporadic losses, particularly in older women [2][3][5]. However, the findings are not consistent across all studies [1][4].

"," The studies examined provide evidence on the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception in both recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss. A large-scale study (n=24,900) found clinically significant abnormalities in 55.8% of samples, with no clear distinction between sporadic and recurrent losses [4]. Another study (n=1,102) found a similar rate of chromosomal aneuploidy in both types of losses, except for higher rates of sex chromosome abnormalities in sporadic losses [12]. A third study (n=1,010) found a higher frequency of chromosomal variants in the sporadic abortion group, particularly in women aged â¥35 years, compared to the recurrent miscarriage group [8]. A study comparing rates of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception found higher rates in sporadic compared to recurrent pregnancy loss, especially in women under 30 [3]. However, a meta-analysis of 55 studies found no significant difference in chromosomal abnormalities between sporadic and recurrent losses [11].

"," While there is some variability in the findings, the evidence generally suggests that there are not fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception in recurrent pregnancy loss compared to sporadic pregnancy loss.

"," The evidence regarding chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception (POC) in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) versus sporadic pregnancy loss is mixed. Several studies and reviews suggest that chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of both recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. A large retrospective cohort study with 2383 cases found that 56.9% of RPL cases had causative chromosomal abnormalities, with numerical abnormalities being the most common [3]. Another retrospective cohort study involving 1,102 women found no significant difference in aneuploid rates between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss, except for sex chromosome abnormalities being higher in sporadic pregnancy loss [5]. A meta-analysis of 55 studies found no significant difference in the percentage of detected chromosomal abnormalities between women with sporadic pregnancy loss and those with RPL [6]. Another study with a large sample size of 24,900 POC samples found clinically significant abnormalities in 55.8% of samples [11]. A retrospective cohort study involving 43 RPL patients found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC in the RPL group compared to sporadic losses [13]. However, a meta-analysis of 19 studies with 8320 POCs found a higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss compared to RPL [19]. A cross-sectional study analyzing 1556 POCs found significant differences in the incidence and distribution of chromosomal abnormalities between the SA and RPL groups [20]. 

"," The current evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that there are fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception in recurrent pregnancy loss compared to sporadic pregnancy loss. The incidence and distribution of chromosomal abnormalities appear to vary between these two groups, but the direction and magnitude of these differences are inconsistent across studies.

","The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception from recurrent pregnancy loss is higher than that of sporadic pregnancy loss. Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of spontaneous pregnancy loss in the first trimester. To determine the cause of this type of abortion, an evaluation of the miscarried tissue and a genetic evaluation should be offered to couples who experience two or more consecutive pregnancy losses. While the risk of early pregnancy loss due to chromosomal abnormalities decreases with increasing gestational age, for women 45 years of age and older the risk is still as high as 80%. Other risk factors associated with early pregnancy loss include alcohol consumption, smoking, and cocaine use.",0.8137948513031006,0.24107142857142855,0.3129443168217354,47.89737678280607,0.11694915254237288,0.7195910578694195,0.0,0.649456172304995,0.31811178686312674,0.821636438369751,0.2415458937198068,0.3119066066509249,45.635317712369144,0.11016949152542373,0.7350816388731658,0.0,0.6410510248326241,0.3135027128684511,0.8198854923248291,0.22343324250681199,0.23850535782625332,40.37456687047246,0.14036697247706423,1.0,0.0,0.6083282770382034,0.3277514643701284,0.8237106800079346,0.24761904761904763,0.24019383121069288,45.88112985864104,0.16339066339066338,1.0,0.0,0.6189116890805652,0.3288344467020972,0.8049792647361755,0.18181818181818182,0.32037055420046523,39.129596725251574,0.0847457627118644,0.8316037239200909,0.0,0.6023717472220168,0.3055048419104189,0.826508641242981,0.25766871165644173,0.2360719810834266,43.83978092618743,0.14942528735632185,1.0,0.0,0.6221880806343896,0.3256927393268455,0.8228899836540222,0.273972602739726,0.2689208579857861,46.55791647282029,0.15459610027855153,0.8595892880866973,0.0,0.6224922437546989,0.32512411302909633,0.8123221397399902,0.15384615384615383,0.28057395143487857,35.1472904929543,0.059322033898305086,0.8159243238104292,0.0,0.6753424148301821,0.3059389975611015,0.8164196014404297,0.25287356321839083,0.21224551535814437,35.66542841519373,0.1424,1.0,0.0,0.6069523881583458,0.3268687937335408,0.8138019442558289,0.25721784776902884,0.236498705736987,40.48927399957405,0.15779092702169625,1.0,0.0,0.6058502674364207,0.32638771280708,0.822009801864624,0.21164021164021163,0.348740812402648,46.706976088500795,0.08644067796610169,0.7395112461040637,0.0,0.6617645597265612,0.31828418574081874,0.842526912689209,0.29343629343629346,0.35156249999999994,50.03141778292831,0.2288135593220339,0.7653010978658646,0.0,0.640984990944465,0.3392804005362955,0.8278175592422485,0.25396825396825395,0.311871603987507,47.631510172359896,0.15423728813559323,0.6678411053540587,0.0,0.6382343986608686,0.3252824440219561
family medicine,primary care infectious disease,Chlamydia prevalence in the general population: is there a sex difference? a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
The focus of Chlamydia trachomatis screening and testing lies more on women than on men. The study aim was to establish by systematic review the prevalence of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and women in the general population.

METHODS:
Electronic databases and reference lists were searched from 2000 to 2013 using the key words ""Chlamydia trachomatis"", ""population-based study"" and ""disease prevalence"". Reference lists were checked. Studies were included in the analysis if Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was reported for both men and women in a population-based study. Prevalence rates for men and women were described as well as highest prevalence rate by age and sex. The difference in prevalence between the sexes in each study was calculated.

RESULTS:
Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment for the review. In nine of the twenty-five studies there was a statistically significant sex difference in the chlamydia prevalence. In all nine studies the prevalence of chlamydia was higher in women than in men. The prevalence for women varied from 1.1% to 10.6% and for men from 0.1% to 12.1%. The average chlamydia prevalence is highly variable between countries. The highest prevalence of chlamydia occurred predominantly in younger age groups (< 25 years). The absence of symptoms in population-based urogenital chlamydia infection is common in men and women (mean 88.5% versus 68.3%).

CONCLUSIONS:
The urogenital chlamydia trachomatis prevalence in the general population is more similar than dissimilar for men and women. A modest sex difference is apparent.

In a general population setting in Sweden, the prevalence was reported to be higher in males (6.0%) than in females (4.6%) [2]. However, in a school-based study in Louisiana, the prevalence was higher in girls (9.7%) compared to boys (4.0%) [10]. Similarly, in the general population of France, the prevalence of Chlamydia was slightly higher in women (1.6%) than in men (1.4%) [15]. A study in Australia found similar prevalence rates in non-Indigenous men and women (1.5% and 1.4% respectively) [7]. In Slovenia, the prevalence was found to be higher in men (3.0%) compared to women (1.6%) [6]. A study in the Netherlands reported higher seroprevalence, indicating past infection, in women than in men [5]. Among incarcerated populations, the prevalence was higher in women (12.31%) than in men (5.75%) [13]. However, these studies have varying levels of bias and limitations, including selection bias, self-selection bias, and limitations in testing methods or incomplete reporting.

TL;DR: The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection varies between genders and can be higher in either males or females depending on the population and setting, as shown by several studies with varying levels of bias and limitations.

A study in Malaysia found a higher prevalence in females (28.1%) compared to males (17.6%) [1]. A systematic review in Australia also found a higher prevalence in women under 25 years in community settings (5.0%) compared to men under 30 years (3.9%) [2]. However, a study in the United States found no significant gender differences in prevalence [3]. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated a higher global prevalence in women (4.2%) compared to men (2.7%) [4]. A study in French Guiana found a higher prevalence in women (24.3%) than in men (12.0%) [5], while a study in Slovenia found a higher prevalence in men (3.0%) compared to women (1.6%) [12]. A study in the Netherlands found a higher prevalence in women (5.6%) compared to men (1.1%) [7], and a study in the US found a higher prevalence in women (12-14%) compared to men (7%) [8]. A study in Aboriginal Australians found a higher prevalence in females compared to males [9], as did a study in incarcerated populations [10]. A study in China found similar prevalences in males (2.7%) and females (2.3%) [15]. A study in Germany found similar overall prevalences in males and females [16].

family medicine,primary care oncology,Are mind-body therapies effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To assess whether mind-body therapies are effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults, since at least one-third of adults with cancer are affected by moderate or severe pain.

METHODS:
We searched for all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that included adults (â¥18 years) with cancer-related pain who were treated with mind-body therapies (mindfulness, hypnosis, yoga, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation) in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science Citation Index, Web of Science, trials registers, and reference lists. The primary outcome was pain intensity. We calculated the standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the risk of bias.

RESULTS:
We identified 40 primary studies involving a total of 3569 participants. The meta-analysis included 24 studies (2404 participants) and showed a significant effect of -0.39 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.16) with considerable heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 86.3%, pÂ <Â 0.001). After we excluded four ""outlier"" studies in sensitivity analyses, the effect size remained significant but weaker. There was a high risk of bias in all studies, for example, performance bias due to lack of participant blinding. Patients in multiple settings were included but many studies were of low quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
Mind-body therapies may be effective in improving cancer pain, but the quality of the evidence is low. There is a need for further high-quality clinical trials.","To assess whether mind-body therapies are effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults, since at least one-third of adults with cancer are affected by moderate or severe pain.","We searched for all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that included adults (â¥18 years) with cancer-related pain who were treated with mind-body therapies (mindfulness, hypnosis, yoga, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation) in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science Citation Index, Web of Science, trials registers, and reference lists.

Overall, the papers suggest that mind-body therapies may be a useful treatment option for cancer-related pain in adults."," Various mind-body therapies have been evaluated for their effects on pain in cancer patients. A randomized controlled trial of Mindful Yoga for women with metastatic breast cancer is currently ongoing [1]. A review of Swedish massage studies found beneficial effects in most cases, including pain reduction [2]. A randomized controlled trial found that perioperative aromatherapy and music therapy, either alone or in combination, were effective in relieving pain in women undergoing breast cancer surgery [3]. Reiki therapy was found to potentially reduce pain and anxiety based on a systematic review and meta-analysis [4]. Hypnosis was suggested as potentially beneficial for managing pain among other cancer-related symptoms based on a review of the current evidence [5]. Traditional Chinese Medicine psycho-behavioral interventions were found to reduce pain in a meta-analysis [6]. Laughter therapy was found to reduce pain in a randomized controlled trial [7]. An 8-week yoga intervention was found to reduce pain in a controlled trial with pre-post design [8]. A literature review found positive effects of therapeutic touch on pain in adult cancer patients [9]. Mind-body therapies such as mindfulness, hypnosis, acupuncture, and yoga were mentioned as providing significant pain relief in an overview article [10]. Clinical hypnosis and self-hypnosis were found to significantly decrease chronic pain in a nonrandomized clinical trial [11].

"," Evidence from a variety of studies suggests that mind-body therapies, including yoga, massage, aromatherapy, music therapy, Reiki, hypnosis, Traditional Chinese Medicine, laughter therapy, and therapeutic touch, may be effective in relieving cancer-related pain in adults. However, the strength of evidence varies, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the most effective therapies.

"," Multiple studies have examined the impact of mind-body therapies on cancer-related pain in adults, with varying results. Therapeutic touch showed positive effects on pain and other symptoms in cancer patients [1]. Hypnosis was found to be effective in managing pain and other symptoms in cancer patients, but more research is needed for populations beyond women with breast cancer [2]. Swedish massage showed beneficial results in most cases [3]. Mind-body practices such as qigong, tai chi, and yoga showed promising effects on managing cancer-related symptoms, but their effects on pain were inconsistent [4]. An 8-week yoga intervention showed reduced scores in pain among women with breast cancer-related lymphedema [5]. Laughter therapy resulted in less pain for a short period [6]. Reiki therapy suggested effectiveness for pain [7]. Mind-body therapies showed effectiveness in addressing physical and psychosocial symptoms, including pain [8]. Aromatherapy and music therapy were effective in relieving pain in women undergoing breast cancer surgery [9]. However, many of these studies note the need for more rigorous research designs, larger sample sizes, and longer follow-up periods.

"," While evidence suggests that mind-body therapies can be effective in relieving cancer-related pain in adults, the strength and consistency of these effects vary across different therapies and studies, underscoring the need for more rigorous research.

"," Several studies indicate that mind-body therapies may be effective in relieving cancer-related pain in adults. Aromatherapy and music therapy have been shown to reduce pain and anxiety in women undergoing breast cancer surgery [1]. Hypnosis may also be effective in managing pain and reducing anxiety [2]. A meta-analysis of 24 studies indicated that mind-body therapies could potentially improve cancer pain, but the quality of the evidence was low due to high risk of bias [3]. Therapeutic touch showed positive effects on pain in adult cancer patients [4]. Practices like qigong, tai chi, and yoga showed promising effects in reducing fatigue and anxiety, but their effects on pain were inconsistent [5]. Other mind-body therapies, including relaxation and imagery, hypnosis, yoga, meditation, Tai Chi and Qigong, and creative therapies, also showed potential in addressing physical and psychosocial symptoms in people with cancer [6]. Yoga was found to improve quality of life and reduce pain in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema [7]. Reiki therapy may be effective for relieving pain and anxiety [8]. Swedish massage showed beneficial results, including reduced lower-back pain [9]. Laughter therapy improved cognitive function and reduced pain for a short period [10]. Acupuncture, reflexology, or acupressure may be recommended for general cancer pain or musculoskeletal pain, and massage may be recommended for pain during palliative or hospice care [11].

"," Mind-body therapies, including aromatherapy, music therapy, hypnosis, therapeutic touch, qigong, tai chi, yoga, and massage, may be effective in relieving cancer-related pain in adults, but the quality of evidence varies and further high-quality research is needed.

","Mind-body therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), art therapy, and motor cortex stimulation, can be effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults. Research has shown that after an MBSR program with modifications to accommodate cancer patients' specific needs, improvements to psychological measures are comparable to the benefits observed with a standard MBSR program. Intrathecal therapy can be successful for relieving both chronic cancer and non-malignant pain. For cancer patients, art therapy can improve symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, anorexia, and anxiety, as well as enhance overall well-being. It has been shown to have a positive effect on health-related quality of life, reducing depression and anxiety and improving coping skills. Motor cortex stimulation has variable results, but they have been encouraging. Additionally, teaching patients and their caregivers appropriate coping skills can have a significant impact on their wellbeing.",0.8176549077033997,0.21238938053097345,0.12689658802123277,17.444801387391546,0.046242774566473986,1.0,0.0,0.5856945882825291,0.3138919311995289,0.8123165369033813,0.20168067226890754,0.1012723694833154,16.99007017063913,0.04358974358974359,1.0,0.0,0.5555351782689052,0.31265716837666974,0.7534101009368896,0.08387096774193548,0.04793637910987744,6.360471603819027,0.022137404580152672,1.0,0.0,0.4447240137383151,0.27436983952756516,0.7444943189620972,0.096,0.048399391387594276,7.455605372574632,0.01873767258382643,1.0,0.0,0.43932087171748774,0.2595835035558271,0.8368106484413147,0.3023255813953489,0.15809119691264353,21.223915440224257,0.08029197080291971,1.0,0.0,0.581016039564496,0.3277693180610122,0.7707347869873047,0.104,0.054690189328743546,7.6944982877581145,0.02446183953033268,1.0,0.0,0.4924994215517741,0.2931932254562776,0.7712082266807556,0.11374407582938388,0.060015479679748275,8.784204529454847,0.02810304449648712,1.0,0.0,0.4880716728001106,0.2879831927762374,0.8654287457466125,0.39999999999999997,0.25854007371142523,32.142069035902715,0.11643835616438356,1.0,0.0,0.6775170755386353,0.35785257446336194,0.7757636904716492,0.14189189189189189,0.06903692071738188,8.779674191849555,0.04317111459968603,1.0,0.0,0.4759425000313928,0.2954241993519116,0.7695252299308777,0.1411764705882353,0.0630145441919679,9.56430942423481,0.04579439252336449,1.0,0.0,0.47695622932246595,0.28815839304965946,0.8681946992874146,0.5074626865671643,0.3392330383480826,40.67305009611801,0.18681318681318682,1.0,0.0,0.6361947682548742,0.3601807581446117,0.7864334583282471,0.1411764705882353,0.09505504387672106,10.007880846837704,0.03684210526315789,1.0,0.0,0.5420204248883962,0.2896005704522342,0.7751443982124329,0.12790697674418605,0.08201271592956128,11.003876955809234,0.034482758620689655,1.0,0.0,0.4880368584487105,0.2818046909814272
family medicine,primary care oncology,Systematic review update of observational studies further supports aspirin role in cancer treatment: Time to share evidence and decision-making with patients?,"BACKGROUND:
Evidence is growing that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with an increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread. We therefore extended up to August 2017 an earlier systematic search and meta-analyses of published studies of low-dose aspirin taken by patients with a diagnosis of cancer.

METHODS:
Searches were completed in Medline and Embase to August 2017 using a pre-defined search strategy to identify reports of relevant studies. References in all the selected papers were scanned. Two reviewers independently applied pre-determined eligibility criteria and extracted data on cause-specific cancer deaths, overall mortality and the occurrence of metastatic spread. Meta-analyses were then conducted for different cancers and heterogeneity and publication bias assessed. Sensitivity analyses and attempts to reduce heterogeneity were conducted.

RESULTS:
Analyses of 29 studies reported since an earlier review up to April 2015 are presented in this report, and these are then pooled with the 42 studies in our earlier publication. Overall meta-analyses of the 71 studies are presented, based on a total of over 120 thousand patients taking aspirin. Ten of the studies also give evidence on the incidence of metastatic cancer spread. There are now twenty-nine observational studies describing colorectal cancer (CRC) and post-diagnostic aspirin. Pooling the estimates of reduction by aspirin which are reported as hazard ratios (HR), gives an overall HR for aspirin and CRC mortality 0.72 (95% CI 0.64-0.80). Fourteen observational studies have reported on aspirin and breast cancer mortality and pooling those that report the association with aspirin as a hazard ratio gives HR 0.69 (0.53-0.90). Sixteen studies report on aspirin and prostate cancer mortality and a pooled estimate yields an HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.73-1.05). Data from 12 reports relating to other cancers are also listed. Ten studies give evidence of a reduction in metastatic spread; four give a pooled HR 0.31 (95% CI 0.18, 0.54) and five studies which reported odds ratio of metastatic spread give OR 0.79 (0.66 to 0.95).

CONCLUSION:
Being almost entirely from observational studies, the evidence of benefit from aspirin is limited. There is heterogeneity between studies and the results are subject to important biases, only some of which can be identified. Nevertheless, the evidence would seem to merit wide discussion regarding whether or not it is adequate to justify the recommendation of low-dose therapeutic aspirin, and if it is, for which cancers?",Evidence is growing that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with an increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread.

Being almost entirely from observational studies, the evidence of benefit from aspirin is limited. There is heterogeneity between studies and the results are subject to important biases, only some of which can be identified. Nevertheless, the evidence would seem to merit wide discussion regarding whether or not it is adequate to justify the recommendation of low-dose therapeutic aspirin, and if it is, for which cancers."," The use of low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer appears to be associated with increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread in some contexts. A retrospective cohort study found that aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival in patients with wild-type BRAF tumors, but not in those with BRAF mutated tumors [1]. Another observational population-based study found that aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of overall mortality, but this was not observed in rectal cancer patients [4]. An animal study suggested that acetylic salicylic acid (ASA), a form of aspirin, did not compromise the efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy in bladder cancer [3]. A review of epidemiological trials suggested that regular aspirin use can reduce mortality and improve survival in patients with esophageal cancer [6]. However, a study assessing the cytotoxic effect of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on ovarian carcinoma cells found that acetylsalicylic acid had no cytotoxic effect [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled adjuvant study called ASCOLT is currently underway to evaluate the role of low-dose aspirin as a treatment in patients with colorectal cancer [2].

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer may be associated with increased survival and reduced metastatic spread in certain types of cancer, including colon and esophageal cancer, but not in others such as ovarian cancer. More research, particularly randomized controlled trials, is needed to confirm these findings.

","[28125730, 22168568, 10210443, 22454078, 11479895, 29850157, 21735687]","[20870917, 15666100, 27491389]"," The use of low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment in cancer patients has shown mixed results across studies. In a cohort study of 999 colon cancer patients, survival benefits from low-dose aspirin use were found to be significantly associated with the expression of HLA class I antigen [1]. However, no significant association was found between aspirin use and survival among tumors with loss of HLA antigen expression [1]. Another randomized controlled trial with 1,622 postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients found no statistical association between low-dose aspirin use and event-free survival or distant disease-free survival, but it was associated with worse overall survival [4]. The ASAC trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled study that aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin can improve disease-free survival in patients treated for colorectal cancer liver metastases, is currently underway and may provide further insights [2]. A systematic review found that long-term use of aspirin was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer and mortality, suggesting potential benefits of aspirin use as an adjuvant treatment [3].

TL;DR: The evidence on whether low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with increased survival and reduction in metastatic spread is mixed, with some studies showing benefits in certain patient populations and others showing no benefit or even potential harm. More research is needed to clarify these relationships.

","[24687028, 34544470, 32508354, 29554282]",[23098790]," Aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer has been investigated in multiple studies with varying results. For colorectal cancer patients, several population-based studies found that aspirin use after diagnosis was associated with decreased overall mortality and recurrence rates [1,3,7,15,17], although one study found no association between aspirin use and improved overall survival [6]. The survival benefit of aspirin was observed in patients with wild-type BRAF tumors, but not in those with BRAF mutated tumors [7]. A study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma found that aspirin use was associated with better disease-free survival [2]. In patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, aspirin use was associated with improved overall and disease-specific survival rates [9]. However, for gastric adenocarcinoma, preoperative aspirin use did not decrease the risk of 5-year all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality [16]. A meta-analysis of 71 studies also suggested a reduction in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer mortality, as well as a reduction in metastatic spread with aspirin use [18]. However, these results were derived mainly from observational studies, which may introduce biases and limit the strength of the evidence. 

TL;DR: There is some evidence suggesting that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer could be associated with increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread, particularly in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.

Several studies have suggested that low-dose aspirin may be associated with increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread in certain types of cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of using low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer. It is important for individuals to consult with their healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.","The papers suggest that low-dose aspirin may be associated with increased survival and reduced metastatic spread in cancer patients. Elwood 2018 found that aspirin was associated with a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, while Elwood 2021 found that aspirin was associated with a reduction in cancer deaths across multiple types of cancer. Elwood 2016 also found that aspirin was associated with a reduction in mortality across multiple types of cancer, and Langley 2011 suggests that aspirin may have additional mechanisms of action beyond Cox-2 inhibition that contribute to its anti-cancer effect. However, the evidence is limited to observational studies, and the studies are subject to biases and heterogeneity. The authors suggest that randomized trials are needed to confirm the benefits of aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer."," The use of low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer appears to be associated with increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread in some contexts. A retrospective cohort study found that aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival in patients with wild-type BRAF tumors, but not in those with BRAF mutated tumors [1]. Another observational population-based study found that aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of overall mortality, but this was not observed in rectal cancer patients [4]. An animal study suggested that acetylic salicylic acid (ASA), a form of aspirin, did not compromise the efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy in bladder cancer [3]. A review of epidemiological trials suggested that regular aspirin use can reduce mortality and improve survival in patients with esophageal cancer [6]. However, a study assessing the cytotoxic effect of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on ovarian carcinoma cells found that acetylsalicylic acid had no cytotoxic effect [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled adjuvant study called ASCOLT is currently underway to evaluate the role of low-dose aspirin as a treatment in patients with colorectal cancer [2].

"," Current evidence suggests that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer may be associated with increased survival and reduced metastatic spread in certain types of cancer, including colon and esophageal cancer, but not in others such as ovarian cancer. More research, particularly randomized controlled trials, is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The use of low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment in cancer patients has shown mixed results across studies. In a cohort study of 999 colon cancer patients, survival benefits from low-dose aspirin use were found to be significantly associated with the expression of HLA class I antigen [1]. However, no significant association was found between aspirin use and survival among tumors with loss of HLA antigen expression [1]. Another randomized controlled trial with 1,622 postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients found no statistical association between low-dose aspirin use and event-free survival or distant disease-free survival, but it was associated with worse overall survival [4]. The ASAC trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled study that aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin can improve disease-free survival in patients treated for colorectal cancer liver metastases, is currently underway and may provide further insights [2]. A systematic review found that long-term use of aspirin was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer and mortality, suggesting potential benefits of aspirin use as an adjuvant treatment [3].

"," The evidence on whether low-dose aspirin as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with increased survival and reduction in metastatic spread is mixed, with some studies showing benefits in certain patient populations and others showing no benefit or even potential harm. More research is needed to clarify these relationships.

"," Aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer has been investigated in multiple studies with varying results. For colorectal cancer patients, several population-based studies found that aspirin use after diagnosis was associated with decreased overall mortality and recurrence rates [1,3,7,15,17], although one study found no association between aspirin use and improved overall survival [6]. The survival benefit of aspirin was observed in patients with wild-type BRAF tumors, but not in those with BRAF mutated tumors [7]. A study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma found that aspirin use was associated with better disease-free survival [2]. In patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, aspirin use was associated with improved overall and disease-specific survival rates [9]. However, for gastric adenocarcinoma, preoperative aspirin use did not decrease the risk of 5-year all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality [16]. A meta-analysis of 71 studies also suggested a reduction in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer mortality, as well as a reduction in metastatic spread with aspirin use [18]. However, these results were derived mainly from observational studies, which may introduce biases and limit the strength of the evidence. 

"," There is some evidence suggesting that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer could be associated with increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread, particularly in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. However, the evidence is mainly derived from observational studies, which can introduce biases, and results vary across cancer types. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

","Low-dose aspirin has been studied as an adjuvant treatment of cancer, with evidence of protective effects observed in colorectal cancer, GCA, prostate cancer, and COVID-19. With regards to increased survival and reduced metastatic spread, findings from a randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence after 55.7 months with an HR of 0.56. There is also suggestive evidence of a beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin and other NSAIDs on adenocarcinoma development in patients with Barrett's esophagus, though significant side effects may outweigh potential benefits. Therefore, routine use of these drugs is not recommended.",0.7855283617973328,0.19444444444444445,0.1738254364089776,30.91782262687027,0.0660377358490566,0.9255769447258809,0.0,0.5930940104382378,0.28921044049882333,0.7940981984138489,0.18045112781954883,0.20110957004160887,34.636318432841094,0.09090909090909091,0.8278171788810087,0.0,0.58852686652218,0.29376142319272563,0.7405998110771179,0.1059190031152648,0.07177937287495277,12.936774971536211,0.02899824253075571,1.0,0.0,0.47201725934188404,0.2571999302682229,0.737186849117279,0.1132075471698113,0.0953220654777748,15.488471854106326,0.033860045146726865,1.0,0.0,0.47819574701746825,0.2578378488332504,0.7687603235244751,0.11666666666666667,0.1490066225165563,28.145043386166297,0.05944055944055944,0.8000250312891113,0.0,0.5276038746719491,0.26485100275364276,0.7649927735328674,0.11333333333333333,0.09040034438226431,15.031875965976063,0.039235412474849095,1.0,0.0,0.5060862436230424,0.2731994747076233,0.7589573264122009,0.11336032388663968,0.09668508287292818,17.393899703341468,0.04046997389033943,1.0,0.0,0.5098696609892218,0.27033044090921804,0.8014387488365173,0.17094017094017094,0.18181818181818182,35.65708845504844,0.06293706293706294,0.7532555161544523,0.0,0.5873411536216736,0.2889676141640042,0.761741042137146,0.11076923076923079,0.08601346297681375,15.0080579680609,0.05094991364421416,1.0,0.0,0.49902478050678334,0.2751691207905933,0.7557552456855774,0.08560311284046691,0.08581524482584552,17.940495019739362,0.047058823529411764,1.0,0.0,0.49500880411393205,0.2690200131848104,0.8118435144424438,0.15151515151515152,0.21232876712328763,36.24968069965871,0.15034965034965034,0.8554176516942473,0.0,0.5884339466862295,0.29913975875110443,0.8028182983398438,0.18274111675126903,0.17729009090793402,25.12979102864502,0.08302583025830258,1.0,0.0,0.5696277174002984,0.3001897122588763,0.7604537010192871,0.1437125748502994,0.1636306292913993,28.235060639371433,0.07177033492822966,1.0,0.0,0.5089339054339416,0.2652128189639637
family medicine,primary care pulmonary disease,The weekend effect: does hospital mortality differ by day of the week? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The concept of a weekend effect, poorer outcomes for patients admitted to hospitals at the weekend is not new, but is the focus of debate in England. Many studies have been published which consider outcomes for patients on admitted at the weekend. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate the effect of weekend admission on mortality in UK hospitals.

METHODS:
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the weekend effect in UK hospitals. We used EMBASE, MEDLINE, HMIC, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus to search for relevant papers. We included systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and observational studies) on patients admitted to hospital in the UK and published after 2001. Our outcome was death; studies reporting mortality were included. Reviewers identified studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. Discrepancy in assessment was considered by a third reviewer. All meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects meta-regression to incorporate the heterogeneity into the weighting.

RESULTS:
Forty five articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. 53% of the articles concluded that outcomes for patients either undergoing surgery or admitted at the weekend were worse. We included 39 in the meta-analysis which contributed 50 separate analyses. We found an overall effect of 1.07 [odds ratio (OR)] (95%CI:1.03-1.12), suggesting that patients admitted at the weekend had higher odds of mortality than those admitted during the week. Sub-group analyses suggest that the weekend effect remained when measures of case mix severity were included in the models (OR:1.06 95%CI:1.02-1.10), but that the weekend effect was not significant when clinical registry data was used (OR:1.03 95%CI: 0.98-1.09). Heterogeneity was high, which may affect generalisability.

CONCLUSIONS:
Despite high levels of heterogeneity, we found evidence of a weekend effect in the UK, even after accounting for severity of disease. Further work is required to examine other potential explanations for the ""weekend effect"" such as staffing levels and other organisational factors.

A systematic review of over 10 million patients undergoing elective or urgent/emergent surgery found higher mortality rates for procedures conducted closer to or during the weekend [2]. Similar findings were observed in patients with severe sepsis, with lower mortality rates for those admitted on weekdays compared to weekends [4]. This trend was also noted in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, with higher in-hospital mortality rates for weekend admissions [6]. Studies on patients undergoing emergency percutaneous coronary intervention [17] and those with acute gallstone pancreatitis [23] also reported worse outcomes for weekend admissions. However, not all findings are consistent. Some studies found no significant difference in mortality based on the day of admission, including a large study of over 2.9 million hospital records from four countries [5], a study on acute kidney injury patients [7], and a study of general medicine inpatients [8]. Furthermore, a study on patients with hip fractures found no association between the day of admission and 30-day mortality [13]. A meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies also found no significant difference in hospital mortality based on the day of ICU discharge [21].

TL;DR: The evidence suggests that hospital mortality rates may be higher for weekend admissions compared to weekdays for certain patient populations and conditions, though results are inconsistent and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Moreover, patients who received in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation on weekends had higher 6-month and 1-year mortality compared to those on weekdays [11]. However, other studies have found no significant difference in mortality rates between weekdays and weekends for conditions such as acute gallstone pancreatitis [10], ischemic stroke [5], peripartum cardiomyopathy [8], and in children admitted for acute medical conditions [6].

This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""weekend effect."" Research suggests that patients admitted to the hospital over the weekend may have a higher risk of mortality compared to those admitted on weekdays. This could be due to several factors including reduced staffing, fewer specialist services available, and delays in testing. However, the extent and causes of this effect are still a subject of ongoing research.","Yes, hospital mortality can differ by day of the week. Several studies have shown that there is a variation in mortality rates depending on the day of admission to the hospital. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""weekend effect"" or the ""weekday effect."" 

Research has indicated that patients admitted to the hospital on weekends may have a higher risk of mortality compared to those admitted on weekdays. This could be attributed to various factors such as reduced staffing levels, limited access to certain diagnostic tests or procedures, and delayed interventions during weekends. 

However, it is important to note that the exact extent and significance of the weekend effect may vary across different healthcare systems and hospitals. Additionally, other factors such as patient characteristics, severity of illness, and hospital resources can also influence mortality rates.","The papers have mixed findings on whether hospital mortality differs by day of the week. Haddock 2016 found that 30-day mortality was higher on weekends than weekdays in a renal unit, but mortality expressed as a death rate/day did not differ between weekend/weekday admissions. Ruiz 2015 found that adjusted odds of 30-day death were higher for weekend emergency admissions in hospitals in England, the USA, and the Netherlands, but not in Australia. Weng 2006 found no association between hospital mortality and day of the week of ICU admission. Finally, Ruiz 2015 found that consultant seniority did not significantly predict 30-day mortality following elective surgery by day of the week, but there was a significant end-of-the-week effect after adjusting for patient, consultant, and hospital effects."," There is a significant body of research suggesting a ""weekend effect"" wherein hospital mortality rates differ based on the day of the week. A systematic review of over 10 million patients undergoing elective or urgent/emergent surgery found higher mortality rates for procedures conducted closer to or during the weekend [2]. Similar findings were observed in patients with severe sepsis, with lower mortality rates for those admitted on weekdays compared to weekends [4]. This trend was also noted in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, with higher in-hospital mortality rates for weekend admissions [6]. Studies on patients undergoing emergency percutaneous coronary intervention [17] and those with acute gallstone pancreatitis [23] also reported worse outcomes for weekend admissions. However, not all findings are consistent. Some studies found no significant difference in mortality based on the day of admission, including a large study of over 2.9 million hospital records from four countries [5], a study on acute kidney injury patients [7], and a study of general medicine inpatients [8]. Furthermore, a study on patients with hip fractures found no association between the day of admission and 30-day mortality [13]. A meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies also found no significant difference in hospital mortality based on the day of ICU discharge [21].

"," The evidence suggests that hospital mortality rates may be higher for weekend admissions compared to weekdays for certain patient populations and conditions, though results are inconsistent and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The association between hospital mortality and the day of the week is complex and appears to be influenced by various factors, including the type of medical condition, the specific hospital setting, and the nature of the medical intervention. Some studies have suggested a ""weekend effect,"" where hospital mortality rates are higher for patients admitted or undergoing procedures on weekends [1,4,11]. For instance, one study found that the odds of early surgical mortality were higher on the weekend compared to the weekday [1]. Similarly, patients with cerebral infarction hospitalized on weekends had a higher risk of in-hospital death compared to those hospitalized on weekdays [4]. Moreover, patients who received in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation on weekends had higher 6-month and 1-year mortality compared to those on weekdays [11]. However, other studies have found no significant difference in mortality rates between weekdays and weekends for conditions such as acute gallstone pancreatitis [10], ischemic stroke [5], peripartum cardiomyopathy [8], and in children admitted for acute medical conditions [6]. Furthermore, a large observational study found no difference in short- and long-term mortality after emergency general surgery based on the day of the week [2]. A systematic review suggested a slightly higher risk of mortality for weekend admissions, but the overall quality of evidence was rated as ""very low"" [7].

"," The evidence on whether hospital mortality differs by the day of the week is mixed and seems to depend on various factors such as the type of medical condition and the specific hospital setting. Some studies suggest higher mortality rates for weekend admissions or procedures, but others find no significant difference. The overall quality of the evidence is variable, with some studies rated as having ""very low"" quality.

"," The link between hospital mortality and the day of the week presents mixed findings. A large observational study in Scotland found no significant difference in mortality for patients undergoing emergency general surgery on weekends compared to weekdays [1]. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that patients admitted at the weekend had higher odds of mortality than those admitted during the week [2]. Another meta-analysis of elective and urgent/emergent surgery studies showed increased odds of mortality as the week approached the weekend and for patients admitted on the weekend [3]. A study on congestive heart failure admissions found higher in-hospital mortality for weekend admissions [4], while a study on stroke patients in Japan found slightly higher 7-day case fatality rates for weekend admissions [5]. A study on hip fractures found no association between the day of admission and 30-day mortality, but did find increased mortality associated with Sunday surgery and discharge [6]. A large retrospective cohort study found higher odds of in-hospital death for weekend ICU admissions [7]. A study on percutaneous coronary intervention found higher mortality rates for nighttime and weekend procedures [8]. A study on stroke patients in Brazil found higher case-fatality rates for hemorrhagic stroke patients admitted on weekends [9]. A study on pediatric cardiac arrest did not specifically address day of the week effects [10].

","This text does not address the question of whether hospital mortality differs by day of the week. However, it does provide information about other aspects of hospital mortality. The guidelines recognize hospital mortality before a patient’s discharge and valve-related mortality as distinct from 30-day mortality. Most protocols recommended an overnight stay following the procedure, as same-day discharge has been found to be correlated with increased morbidity and mortality. Data from US Medicare beneficiaries showed 30-day and 1-year mortality rates post-admission of 10.8% and 30.7% respectively, with a clear relationship with age for mortality outcomes at one year. People generally prefer not to die in the hospital, and data of community-living elders showed that days spent at home in the last six months of life did not differ by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.",0.8186676502227783,0.24313725490196078,0.2586336062858345,40.0550871466054,0.1377049180327869,0.932375478927203,0.0,0.6575839315691302,0.32270625555775967,0.8111505508422852,0.21,0.2952364997384937,40.7087709046617,0.11089494163424124,0.7401729283913192,0.0,0.6539352270223762,0.31268430546258513,0.7842507362365723,0.15176151761517617,0.13985651804063565,26.0046669033868,0.06303972366148532,1.0,0.0,0.5546100971442235,0.2932091041491189,0.7794495224952698,0.1566265060240964,0.14048296802353163,28.911307749588865,0.06841046277665996,1.0,0.0,0.5532349500342877,0.2894362726854825,0.797924816608429,0.07792207792207793,0.20607375271149675,30.624350833570002,0.02529182879377432,0.7918263090676884,0.0,0.6612760207137546,0.292078238943212,0.780285656452179,0.14180929095354522,0.1169850440560137,24.334616422669107,0.05743740795287187,1.0,0.0,0.5518092676759401,0.29316470885890344,0.7810535430908203,0.1592920353982301,0.1448083645222795,29.48167122892454,0.07197696737044146,1.0,0.0,0.5537457506902315,0.2938600658544226,0.7963166236877441,0.14973262032085563,0.2485656872920849,35.43679799140979,0.06809338521400778,0.7782067159461795,0.0,0.6201784412066141,0.2916648113791641,0.7790071964263916,0.14257425742574256,0.1043216367936594,20.182902270156834,0.07021517553793885,1.0,0.0,0.5426163710653782,0.2917246469875467,0.7683079838752747,0.15452538631346577,0.09532085583801965,21.68852950532289,0.07516339869281045,1.0,0.0,0.5391113111534371,0.284494071045262,0.7996377348899841,0.08284023668639053,0.23988973219102225,35.860222274876016,0.04669260700389105,0.7698365916756721,0.0,0.6422505053606901,0.29352982457449434,0.7878111600875854,0.13545816733067728,0.1910360029390154,34.63044136761763,0.08762886597938144,0.8562820746728793,0.0,0.5876707593096963,0.29232557933094544,0.7622978687286377,0.11450381679389313,0.1404109589041096,28.648579106987736,0.06885245901639345,0.9121612033489428,0.0,0.5408164698609038,0.2719536802433984
family medicine,primary care pulmonary disease,Can body mass index predict clinical outcomes for patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The effects of body mass index (BMI) on the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are controversial. We aimed to further determine the relationship between BMI and the acute outcomes of patients with ARDS.

METHODS:
We searched the Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ISI Web of Science for trials published between 1946 and July 2016, using ""BMI"" or ""body mass index"" or ""overweight"" or ""obese"" and ""ARDS"" or ""ALI"" or ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"" or ""acute lung injury"", without limitations on publication type or language. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were conducted, and a random-effects model was applied to calculate the odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD). Review Manager (RevMan) was used to test the hypothesis using the Mann-Whitney U test. The primary outcome was unadjusted mortality, and secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation (MV)-free days and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital.

RESULTS:
Five trials with a total of 6268 patients were pooled in our final analysis. There was statistical heterogeneity between normal-weight and overweight patients in LOS in the ICU (I <sup>2</sup>â=â71%, Ï <sup>2</sup>â=â10.27, Pâ=â0.02) and in MV-free days (I <sup>2</sup>â=â89%, Ï <sup>2</sup>â=â18.45, Pâ<â0.0001). Compared with normal weight, being underweight was associated with higher mortality (OR 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22, 2.08, Pâ=â0.0006), while obesity and morbid obesity were more likely to result in lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57, 0.80, Pâ<â0.00001; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56, 0.93, Pâ=â0.01). MV-free days were much longer in patients with morbid obesity (MD 2.64, 95% CI 0.60, 4.67, Pâ=â0.01), but ICU and hospital LOS were not influenced by BMI. An important limitation of our analysis is the lack of adjustment for age, sex, illness severity, comorbid illness, and interaction of outcome parameters.

Obesity and morbid obesity are associated with lower mortality in patients with ARDS."," The association between body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is complex. Some studies suggest that BMI does not predict mortality in these patients [3], while a higher BMI has been associated with progression to ALI in severe sepsis and septic shock patients [5]. In pediatric ARDS patients, obesity was associated with lower mortality, supporting the obesity paradox [6]. However, severely obese patients with ALI had longer hospital and ICU stays and a greater likelihood of being discharged to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility [3]. Moreover, a higher BMI was associated with lower quality of life in ARDS survivors [7]. Although these studies provided important insights, they varied in design, sample size, and risk of bias, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

TL;DR: The current evidence suggests that body mass index may be associated with certain clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, such as hospital stay duration and quality of life, but it does not consistently predict mortality.

A retrospective cohort study did not find an association between circulating adiponectin (APN) levels and disease severity or mortality in the overall cohort of patients with ARDS [3]. Another retrospective study found that obese patients had lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting an altered inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS patients with high BMI, but BMI was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality [4].

However, a retrospective study of 380 COVID-19 ARDS patients did not identify BMI as a predictor of mortality [2], while another retrospective study of 673 COVID-19 ARDS patients treated with ECMO found that a BMI >35 was associated with higher survival [3]. A study of 4698 mechanically ventilated patients found that obesity was associated with a higher incidence of ARDS, but there were no differences in outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality based on BMI categories [13]. A study of 842 trauma-related ARDS patients found that BMI was an independent risk factor for mortality [6], while another study of 165 COVID-19 ARDS patients found no significant difference in mortality based on BMI [9]. 

TL;DR: Evidence on the predictive value of BMI for clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury/ARDS is mixed, with some studies suggesting that higher BMI may be associated with lower mortality, while others find no significant association or an increased risk of ARDS with higher BMI. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships.

Several studies have investigated the association between BMI and outcomes in ALI/ARDS patients. 

One study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found that higher BMI was associated with improved survival in patients with ALI/ARDS. Another study published in the Journal of Critical Care also reported similar findings, suggesting that higher BMI was associated with lower mortality rates in these patients.

However, it is important to note that the relationship between BMI and clinical outcomes in ALI/ARDS is complex and can be influenced by various factors such as underlying comorbidities, severity of illness, and treatment strategies. Therefore, BMI should be considered as one of the many factors when predicting clinical outcomes in patients with ALI/ARDS, and individual patient characteristics should be taken into account for a comprehensive assessment.","The papers have mixed findings on whether body mass index (BMI) can predict clinical outcomes for patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ni 2017 found that obesity and morbid obesity were associated with lower mortality in patients with ARDS, while Morris 2007 found that severe obesity was associated with increased morbidity and resource utilization in the hospital and after discharge. Gong 2009 found that BMI was associated with increased risk of ARDS in a weight-dependent manner and with increased length of stay, but not with mortality. Soto 2011 found that obesity was associated with increased development of acute kidney injury in ARDS patients, which was not completely explained by severity of illness or shock. Overall, the papers suggest that BMI may have some predictive value for clinical outcomes in ARDS patients, but the relationship is complex and may depend on the specific outcome being studied."," The association between body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is complex. Some studies suggest that BMI does not predict mortality in these patients [3], while a higher BMI has been associated with progression to ALI in severe sepsis and septic shock patients [5]. In pediatric ARDS patients, obesity was associated with lower mortality, supporting the obesity paradox [6]. However, severely obese patients with ALI had longer hospital and ICU stays and a greater likelihood of being discharged to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility [3]. Moreover, a higher BMI was associated with lower quality of life in ARDS survivors [7]. Although these studies provided important insights, they varied in design, sample size, and risk of bias, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

"," The current evidence suggests that body mass index may be associated with certain clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, such as hospital stay duration and quality of life, but it does not consistently predict mortality.

"," Several studies have investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). A large individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis found a trend towards reduced mortality with higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with higher BMI, but the statistical confidence was weak [1]. A secondary analysis of participants in trials of therapy for acute lung injury found that excess body weight was not associated with death, achievement of unassisted ventilation, or number of ventilator-free days [2]. A retrospective cohort study did not find an association between circulating adiponectin (APN) levels and disease severity or mortality in the overall cohort of patients with ARDS [3]. Another retrospective study found that obese patients had lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting an altered inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS patients with high BMI, but BMI was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality [4]. Lastly, a prospective cohort study found that patients with COVID-19 ARDS had a higher BMI compared to non-COVID-19 ARDS patients, but similar 60-day mortality [5].

","The study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 infection and reported that a soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1) and interleukin (IL) 6 had high prognostic accuracy for 30-day intubation/mortality and oxygen requirement, respectively. It also showed that combining respiratory rate and sTREM-1 predicted 30-day intubation/mortality with 94% sensitivity, and an IL-6-based algorithm with respiratory rate had 98% sensitivity for 30-day oxygen requirement. Obesity (body mass index > 30) has been suggested as a predictor of a difficult airway, but it is not clear if it can predict clinical outcomes for patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Studies have suggested that increasing BMI correlates with lower levels of VC, TLC, and RV, but these values remain within normal limits. The use of scoring systems such as the CURB-65 and the pneumonia severity index, combined with inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6, or procalcitonin, has been suggested to predict the prognosis of pneumonia patients in general.

family medicine,spinal disease and back pain,Is sequestrectomy a viable alternative to microdiscectomy? A systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Traditionally, lumbar discectomy involves removal of the free disc fragment followed by aggressive or conservative excision of the intervertebral disc. In selected patients, however, it is possible to remove only the free fragment or sequester without clearing the intervertebral disc space. However, there is some controversy about whether that approach is sufficient to prevent recurrent symptoms and to provide adequate pain relief.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
This systematic review was designed to pose two questions: (1) Does performing a sequestrectomy only without conventional microdiscectomy lead to an increased reherniation rate; and (2) is there a difference in the patient-reported levels of radicular pain?

METHODS:
Systematic MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were carried out to identify all articles published in peer-reviewed journals reporting the outcomes of interest for conventional microdiscectomy versus sequestrectomy for lumbar disc herniation from L2 to the sacrum (Level III evidence and above); hand-searching of bibliographies was also performed. A minimum of Level II evidence was required with a followup rate of greater than 75%. Followup in all studies was from 18 to 86Â months. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The studies were analyzed for operating time, hospital stay, pre- and postoperative visual analog scale, and reherniation rate.

RESULTS:
Patients in both the microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy groups showed comparable improvement of visual analog scale (VAS) score for leg pain. VAS score improvement ranged from 5.6 to 6.5 points in the microdiscectomy groups and 5.5 to 6.6 in the sequestrectomy group. The reherniation rate in the microdiscectomy group ranged from 2.3% to 11.8% and in the sequestrectomy groups from 2% to 12.5%.

CONCLUSIONS:
This review of the available literature suggests that, compared with conventional microdiscectomy, microsurgical lumbar sequestrectomy can achieve comparable reherniation rates and reduction in radicular pain when a small breach in the posterior fibrous ring is found intraoperatively.","Traditionally, lumbar discectomy involves removal of the free disc fragment followed by aggressive or conservative excision of the intervertebral disc.

A single-center randomized prospective study [1] and a retrospective cohort study [2] both suggested that sequestrectomy may be a more favorable alternative to microdiscectomy, with the former reporting improved clinical outcomes and the latter reporting shorter operating time, fewer complications, and slightly better postoperative pain improvement. A meta-analysis [3] also found comparable outcomes between the two procedures in terms of reherniation rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain scores, but a shorter duration of surgery for sequestrectomy. However, a comparative study [4] suggested that aggressive microdiscectomy may result in lower reherniation rates. Other studies [5,6,7] found similar results between the two procedures in terms of success rate and recurrence rate. A prospective study [8] and a meta-analysis [10] found no clinically relevant difference in outcome between the two procedures. Finally, a single-center randomized prospective study [9] found less postoperative disc degeneration after sequestrectomy.

TL;DR: Evidence suggests that sequestrectomy may be a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with comparable or potentially superior outcomes reported in several studies. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings.

A prospective analysis of 200 patients reported that sequestrectomy had a shorter hospitalization duration, more favorable results on pain scales, and a lower percentage of back pain compared to the microdiscectomy group [2]. A retrospective cohort study of 101 patients found that sequestrectomy had a shorter operating time, fewer intraoperative complications, and a slightly lower reherniation rate compared to microdiscectomy [13]. A systematic review of seven studies with 929 patients found that sequestrectomy had comparable outcomes to microdiscectomy in terms of reherniation rate, hospital stay, and postoperative pain, but was associated with a shorter duration of surgery [14]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies found that both microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy had good curative results in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with no significant difference in the incidence of re-operation and neuropathic pain [9]. A single-center randomized prospective study of 84 patients found that sequestrectomy demonstrated significantly less postoperative disc degeneration compared to standard microdiscectomy after 2 years [16].

TL;DR: Based on the available evidence, sequestrectomy appears to be a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with similar clinical outcomes and potential advantages such as shorter operation time and hospital stay, and less postoperative disc degeneration.

Both procedures are used to treat herniated discs in the spine. Sequestrectomy involves the removal of the loose fragments of the herniated disc, while microdiscectomy involves the removal of the entire herniated disc. The choice between the two procedures depends on the specific condition of the patient, the location and size of the herniation, and the surgeon's preference. Some studies suggest that sequestrectomy may have fewer complications and a shorter recovery time compared to microdiscectomy. However, more research is needed to definitively compare the long-term outcomes of the two procedures.""","Yes, sequestrectomy is considered a viable alternative to microdiscectomy. Sequestrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a sequestrated disc fragment, which is a portion of the intervertebral disc that has become detached and migrated away from the main disc. Microdiscectomy, on the other hand, involves the removal of a herniated disc using a minimally invasive technique. Both procedures aim to relieve symptoms caused by a herniated disc, such as pain, numbness, and weakness. The choice between sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy depends on various factors, including the specific characteristics of the herniated disc and the patient's individual circumstances. It is important for patients to consult with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment option for their condition.","The papers suggest that sequestrectomy is a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for treating lumbar disc herniation. Fakouri 2015 found that sequestrectomy can achieve comparable reherniation rates and reduction in radicular pain as microdiscectomy. ThomÃÂ© 2005 also found that sequestrectomy does not entail a higher rate of early recurrences compared with microdiscectomy, and demonstrated a trend toward superior results when sequestrectomy is performed. Barth 2008 found that reherniation rates within 2 years after sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy are comparable, but outcome after microdiscectomy seems to worsen over time, whereas it remains stable after sequestrectomy. Morrison 2015 describes the translaminar approach as a useful alternative for cranial sequestrated herniation, which is covered from posterior by the laminar, making an interlaminar approach only possible with a greater bone resection."," A number of studies with varying designs have compared the outcomes of sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. A single-center randomized prospective study [1] and a retrospective cohort study [2] both suggested that sequestrectomy may be a more favorable alternative to microdiscectomy, with the former reporting improved clinical outcomes and the latter reporting shorter operating time, fewer complications, and slightly better postoperative pain improvement. A meta-analysis [3] also found comparable outcomes between the two procedures in terms of reherniation rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain scores, but a shorter duration of surgery for sequestrectomy. However, a comparative study [4] suggested that aggressive microdiscectomy may result in lower reherniation rates. Other studies [5,6,7] found similar results between the two procedures in terms of success rate and recurrence rate. A prospective study [8] and a meta-analysis [10] found no clinically relevant difference in outcome between the two procedures. Finally, a single-center randomized prospective study [9] found less postoperative disc degeneration after sequestrectomy.

"," Evidence suggests that sequestrectomy may be a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with comparable or potentially superior outcomes reported in several studies. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," Several studies have compared the outcomes of sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. A prospective controlled study of 168 patients found that sequestrectomy had similar results to microdiscectomy, with the success of sequestrectomy significantly influenced by the competence of the fibrous ring [1]. A prospective analysis of 200 patients reported that sequestrectomy had a shorter hospitalization duration, more favorable results on pain scales, and a lower percentage of back pain compared to the microdiscectomy group [2]. A retrospective cohort study of 101 patients found that sequestrectomy had a shorter operating time, fewer intraoperative complications, and a slightly lower reherniation rate compared to microdiscectomy [13]. A systematic review of seven studies with 929 patients found that sequestrectomy had comparable outcomes to microdiscectomy in terms of reherniation rate, hospital stay, and postoperative pain, but was associated with a shorter duration of surgery [14]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies found that both microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy had good curative results in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with no significant difference in the incidence of re-operation and neuropathic pain [9]. A single-center randomized prospective study of 84 patients found that sequestrectomy demonstrated significantly less postoperative disc degeneration compared to standard microdiscectomy after 2 years [16].

"," Based on the available evidence, sequestrectomy appears to be a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with similar clinical outcomes and potential advantages such as shorter operation time and hospital stay, and less postoperative disc degeneration. However, the choice of procedure may be influenced by individual patient characteristics and surgical considerations.

"," The systematic review by Azarhomayoun et al. [1] involving five studies and 746 participants reported no significant differences between sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy in terms of leg pain, low back pain, functional outcomes, complications, hospital stay, or recurrence rate for two years, but found sequestrectomy was associated with less analgesic consumption. Similarly, a prospective controlled clinical study [2] and a randomized prospective study [3] found comparable results between the two procedures. However, a retrospective study [4] reported a lower incidence of recurrent herniation requiring further surgery in patients who received conventional diskectomy compared to sequestrectomy. A randomized controlled trial [5] and a retrospective cohort study [6] suggested sequestrectomy had some advantages including shorter surgery duration, lower complication rate, and slightly lower reherniation rate. Another randomized prospective study [7] found sequestrectomy demonstrated significantly less postoperative disc degeneration than standard microdiscectomy after two years. A retrospective cohort study [8] reported lower reherniation rate in aggressive microdiscectomy group compared to sequestrectomy group. A prospective analysis [9] reported sequestrectomy had shorter hospitalization, more favorable pain scores, and lower back pain compared to microdiscectomy. A meta-analysis [12] found sequestrectomy had a shorter duration of surgery compared to microdiscectomy but similar outcomes in terms of reherniation rate, length of hospital stay, and postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scales for leg and back pains. Another meta-analysis [13] found no statistically significant difference in the incidence of re-operation or neuropathic pain VAS scores between microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy. 

"," Based on the available studies, sequestrectomy appears to be a viable alternative to microdiscectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, with comparable outcomes in terms of pain, function, complications, and recurrence rate. However, the evidence is mixed and further high-quality, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

","The available evidence suggests that microdiscectomy is the best method for removing most lumbar disc herniations, as it provides a smaller incision, less traumatic approach, and better visualization of the operative field than standard open discectomy. Evidence from multiple prospective randomized trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated good clinical outcomes with microdiscectomy, and is considered the gold standard of care for lumbar disc herniations. In contrast, sequestrectomy is not considered a viable alternative to microdiscectomy, as there is no evidence to support its efficacy and safety in the treatment of lumbar disc herniations.",0.766349196434021,0.1643835616438356,0.12927756653992392,33.47023714098658,0.06037735849056604,1.0,0.0,0.5705077748939481,0.28039853432541506,0.7785489559173584,0.1691542288557214,0.15097690941385433,36.6860423075331,0.06950672645739911,0.96704,0.0,0.6035947222510973,0.2884456036620152,0.7848516702651978,0.14790996784565916,0.11368605159597726,25.45718088528827,0.053830227743271224,1.0,0.0,0.5636551981757146,0.29661081770535935,0.7869548797607422,0.16296296296296295,0.12813667912439936,29.107584392705476,0.058823529411764705,1.0,0.0,0.5742781734329531,0.29965466290389114,0.7764155864715576,0.10218978102189781,0.1778242677824268,35.581779841131194,0.03980099502487562,0.7312,0.0,0.5907870233058929,0.2770502471686818,0.8046753406524658,0.14246575342465753,0.10801920435333898,21.255376441166156,0.048576214405360134,1.0,0.0,0.5976777568279978,0.3112185114040211,0.8147284388542175,0.16286644951140064,0.14636779284625517,25.997805627784317,0.06236559139784946,1.0,0.0,0.6202940522547228,0.31801874712810935,0.7705157399177551,0.10389610389610389,0.15957446808510636,36.093399958813094,0.0472636815920398,0.7707573200992556,0.0,0.5840501701220487,0.27661889250477256,0.8000494837760925,0.14795918367346939,0.1224007035705365,19.799437436421524,0.051798561151079135,1.0,0.0,0.5742739323007909,0.3077949431206341,0.8020075559616089,0.1415929203539823,0.15341179715155437,22.694984498453984,0.05711775043936731,1.0,0.0,0.5875693356793649,0.3094052887661455,0.7710298895835876,0.14765100671140938,0.1901743264659271,36.1545930217006,0.05721393034825871,0.7508888888888888,0.0,0.5611822103199205,0.2727978041795557,0.8229045271873474,0.21524663677130043,0.20309252217997464,39.09466537190867,0.1348314606741573,1.0,0.0,0.6680917558974998,0.32707480484683077,0.7815702557563782,0.15706806282722513,0.15666866790167003,35.81429568740552,0.07213930348258707,0.8769638095238095,0.0,0.5957296742333307,0.28767654724357405
gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Is tumor necrosis a clinical prognostic factor in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It has been proven that tumor necrosis is associated with poor prognoses in various solid malignant tumors. However, the prognostic effect of tumor necrosis in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers is still unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the associations of tumor necrosis with survival outcomes and clinicopathological features in patients with hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers.

METHODS:
Based on the PRISMA statement, eligible studies were identified from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception until January 2023. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to assess the connection between tumor necrosis and hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers. We then choose which effects model to use to generate pooled HRs and 95% CIs, depending on data heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
In total, 6497 articles were identified, 10 of which were included in this meta-analysis. Our results suggested that the presence of tumor necrosis predicted a poorer outcome for overall survival (HRÂ =Â 1.54, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.35-1.77, pÂ <â0.001) and recurrence-free survival (HRÂ =Â 1.69, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.37-2.08, pÂ <â0.001). In addition, tumor necrosis was correlated with larger tumor size, a higher frequency of lymph node metastasis, poorer histologic differentiation, and higher recurrence and metastasis rates.

CONCLUSION:
Our meta-analysis suggests that hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancer patients with tumor necrosis have dismal survival outcomes, and that their tumors have aggressive biological behaviors. Tumor necrosis has the potential to be a promising biomarker for forecasting poor prognosis in these patients.","It has been proven that tumor necrosis is associated with poor prognoses in various solid malignant tumors.

Another study identified a nine-lncRNA-based signature that could predict prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting the potential for other biomarkers in addition to tumor necrosis [3]. However, the clinical significance of tumor necrosis is still a topic of debate, as shown by the discussion surrounding the measurement of response rate in HCC and the use of tumor necrosis as a prognostic factor [5].

However, one study found that significant lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers was associated with better liver function, smaller tumor size, and lower incidence of tumor necrosis, suggesting a potential protective role of immune infiltration against tumor necrosis [5].

"," Tumor necrosis appears to be a significant clinical prognostic factor associated with poorer outcomes in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers, although the presence of significant immune infiltration may mitigate its effects.

","Tumor necrosis is an important prognostic factor for hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers, with a higher 5-year survival rate for those with 95% or more tumor necrosis. Other prognostic factors include uninvolved neurovascular bundles, soft tissue and bone resection margins, and the level of lactate dehydrogenase and tumor volume. Node positivity is a key factor in determining the overall prognosis, with significantly lower survival rate for those with nodal metastasis. Histology phenotype is also associated with prognosis, with pancreaticobiliary histopathology associated with poor prognosis compared to intestinal type. The prognosis of HCC is further dependent on tumor size, the severity of underlying liver disease, and the presence or absence of metastases. Patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC and those with high levels of alpha-fetoprotein and hepatitis B virus DNA are associated with poor prognosis. Similarly, high levels of serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is associated with poor prognosis and higher recurrence of HCC. In cholangiocarcinoma, the found 5-year overall survival was higher for those patients without multiple tumors or vascular invasion and nodal disease on surgical pathology specimen evaluation.",0.8273584246635437,0.21686746987951805,0.24103614979611301,45.850808258617725,0.12972972972972974,0.815099715099715,0.0,0.6467636887516294,0.3249252689866524,0.8478462100028992,0.1986754966887417,0.2738031505004786,45.05780814512704,0.14450867052023122,0.8146438746438747,0.0,0.6989645108263544,0.3443071131075264,0.82923823595047,0.19696969696969696,0.15263269665711965,32.69682877320221,0.07862407862407862,1.0,0.0,0.6060121293130674,0.32856608455645553,0.8349116444587708,0.2222222222222222,0.1643335362142422,36.88514588163528,0.09037900874635568,1.0,0.0,0.6133288146312267,0.3324647432586533,0.8269791603088379,0.14545454545454548,0.2837821519140201,38.06577851451524,0.03757225433526012,0.8252636252636253,0.0,0.7063173782534715,0.31973030545774045,0.8236170411109924,0.21576763485477177,0.1565298047705403,33.18048820836594,0.07866666666666666,1.0,0.0,0.6096049409646255,0.32806973856354704,0.8200358152389526,0.2095238095238095,0.19239286794673296,36.78160456008202,0.08631921824104234,1.0,0.0,0.6020420043299731,0.32311333093131384,0.8655373454093933,0.16216216216216217,0.35702247191011227,46.07427027761555,0.05491329479768786,0.7724358974358975,0.0,0.7759041354364279,0.3587259923073296,0.8604912757873535,0.2925170068027211,0.22060342076112877,34.43087642523259,0.18112798264642083,1.0,0.0,0.6663944931668148,0.3621686054026769,0.8653473854064941,0.3282442748091603,0.2510827041485444,39.19884994596094,0.20483460559796438,1.0,0.0,0.6818532826863739,0.36758087312313453,0.8409364223480225,0.16071428571428573,0.3289040554775281,41.29648706822622,0.06069364161849711,0.764102564102564,0.0,0.716741019487381,0.33177743254653685,0.8289464712142944,0.23529411764705882,0.26035324462550086,43.44589837510938,0.11271676300578035,0.9035327635327635,0.0,0.6349655643508241,0.3232908442632858,0.824725329875946,0.16603773584905657,0.17245057431819757,29.666365788882366,0.07769423558897243,1.0,0.0,0.6085166759174785,0.32609944926436935
gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Does Caudate Resection Improve Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Curative Resection for Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Margin-negative (R0) resection is the strongest positive prognostic factor in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC). Due to its anatomic location, the caudate lobe is frequently involved in PHC. This review aimed to examine the impact of caudate lobe resection (CLR) in addition to hepatectomy and bile duct resection for patients with PHC.

METHODS:
The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were systematically reviewed from inception to October 2021 to identify studies comparing patients undergoing surgical resection with hepatectomy and bile duct resection with or without CLR for treatment of PHC. Outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving R0 resection, overall survival (OS), and perioperative morbidity.

RESULTS:
Altogether, 949 studies were screened. The review included eight observational studies reporting on 1137 patients. The patients who underwent CLR had a higher likelihood of R0 resection (odds ratio [OR], 5.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64-12.95) and a better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) than those who did not. The use of CLR did not increase the risk of perioperative morbidity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.65-1.63).

CONCLUSIONS:
Given the higher likelihood of R0 resection, improved OS, and no apparent increase in perioperative morbidity, this review supports routine caudate lobectomy in the surgical management of PHC. These results should be interpreted with caution given the lack of high-quality prospective data and the high probability of selection bias.","Margin-negative (R0) resection is the strongest positive prognostic factor in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC).

","Caudate lobe resection combined with right or left hepatectomy, bile duct resection, lymphadenectomy, and sometimes vascular resection is the standard surgical procedure for most perihilar/hilar cholangiocarcinomas. This is done to achieve negative bile duct margins, adequate liver remnant function, and adequate portal and arterial inflow to the liver remnant. While surgery can provide a potential cure for cholangiocarcinoma, outcomes vary depending on factors such as the tumor's location and size, extent of surgery, and other comorbidities. In general, extrahepatic tumors are most susceptible to surgical resection with the best outcomes. Thus, extensive resection of the caudate lobe may be able to improve outcomes for those undergoing curative resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.",0.7824456095695496,0.11464968152866242,0.17508488267474004,26.045712954479903,0.07262569832402235,1.0,0.0,0.5437208890318871,0.2789917861788331,0.7605410814285278,0.147239263803681,0.17773536946283097,26.589089389005526,0.08040201005025126,1.0,0.0,0.5039021206183696,0.2609096146388358,0.7625810503959656,0.10452961672473868,0.07051564565888056,14.691764114667546,0.041407867494824016,1.0,0.0,0.5008897069163216,0.276080266184838,0.7675952911376953,0.12396694214876033,0.08693213684800898,17.85340040001949,0.052,1.0,0.0,0.508473114221675,0.27661913434214846,0.7537434697151184,0.08849557522123892,0.10516252390057362,30.08383526159721,0.034013605442176874,0.7230046948356808,0.0,0.5062356659999261,0.25073407950034177,0.7688167095184326,0.18250950570342203,0.09628645918201073,18.170800187553755,0.04856512141280353,1.0,0.0,0.5107459914464278,0.28201131795106993,0.7833329439163208,0.20487804878048782,0.1427475563785787,23.694596516065676,0.06869009584664537,1.0,0.0,0.5261068300831886,0.28683334767794455,0.7700745463371277,0.14285714285714285,0.14105252061469267,31.060357434708198,0.06462585034013606,0.8609477377083011,0.0,0.5235514470252646,0.2681857532597079,0.8099725842475891,0.178343949044586,0.12331502423263326,19.085606635560485,0.09227871939736347,1.0,0.0,0.5406980204649947,0.3160136576090201,0.798564076423645,0.21951219512195122,0.1525553035314688,22.524458631345095,0.09718670076726342,1.0,0.0,0.5278612742322752,0.30344743794448614,0.8061578869819641,0.2058823529411765,0.2288815592203898,39.153896978579105,0.15306122448979592,0.8738262910798122,0.0,0.6089842573485591,0.3036368762577902,0.776715099811554,0.1411764705882353,0.10729310091483492,23.38534415706,0.057971014492753624,1.0,0.0,0.5408792672333894,0.2801273046458644,0.7439879775047302,0.12021857923497269,0.10279605263157894,21.250798086792656,0.045454545454545456,1.0,0.0,0.4977021949847093,0.2548971704850502
gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Local palliative therapies for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction: radiofrequency ablation combined with stent or biliary stent alone? An updated meta-analysis of nineteen trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in radiofrequency ablation combined with stent (RFAâ+âStent) for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RFAâ+âStent compared with biliary stent alone.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception dates to June 20, 2021, for studies that compared RFAâ+âStent and stent alone for unresectable MBO. The main outcomes were survival, patency, and adverse effects. All meta-analyses were calculated using the random-effects model.

RESULTS:
A total of 19 studies involving 1946 patients were included in this study. Compared with stent alone, RFAâ+âStent was significantly associated with better overall survival (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.48, 0.63; Pâ<â0.00001), longer mean survival time (SMD 2.20; 95% CI 1.17, 3.22; Pâ<â0.0001), longer mean stent patency time (SMD 1.37; 95% CI 0.47, 2.26; Pâ=â0.003), higher stent patency at 6Â months (OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.54, 5.18; Pâ=â0.0008). The two interventions had similar incidence of postoperative abdominal pain (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.94, 1.78; Pâ=â0.11), mild bleeding (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.65, 2.54; Pâ=â0.48), cholangitis (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.76, 1.55; Pâ=â0.65), pancreatitis (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.82, 2.38; Pâ=â0.22). Furthermore, the serum bilirubin levels and stricture diameter after operations were significantly alleviated than before operations, but the degree of alleviation between the two groups were not significantly different (all Pâ>â0.05).

CONCLUSION:
Although the alleviation of serum bilirubin and stricture diameter did not differ between the two interventions, RFAâ+âStent can significantly improve the survival and stent patency with comparable procedure-related adverse events than stent alone. Thus, RFAâ+âStent should be recommended as an attractive alternative to biliary stent alone for patients with unresectable MBO.","Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in radiofrequency ablation combined with stent (RFAâ+âStent) for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO).

Another systematic review of 33 studies with 2974 patients also found better overall survival and longer mean survival time for both RFA and photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined with stent placement compared to stent alone [12]. However, this review also suggested that PDT combined with stent placement might provide better survival than RFA combined with stent placement [12]. A retrospective study of 50 patients suggested that RFA combined with stent placement is safe and feasible, with a median stent patency of 7.0 months and overall survival of 5.0 months [18]. Another retrospective analysis of 64 patients found that RFA combined with stent placement may improve survival compared to stent placement alone [19]. However, these studies are largely retrospective and lack control groups, limiting the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. 

"," Current evidence, primarily from retrospective studies, suggests that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with stent placement may provide better overall survival and longer stent patency time compared to biliary stent alone for palliative treatment of unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. However, the strength of the evidence is limited and further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

","The preffered local palliative therapies for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction is radiofrequency ablation combined with stent placement, rather than biliary stent placement alone. This is supported by evidence from multiple treatment approaches such as systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, palliative treatment, targeted molecular therapy, and immunotherapy. For localized tumors, surgical resection is the only possible chance of cure and the pre-operative assessment should evaluate the size and location of the tumor, vascular and lymph nodes involvement, and presence of metastatic disease. For the palliation of advanced disease, biliary stent placement, photodynamic therpay, transarterial chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation are other option available.",0.8108147382736206,0.18181818181818182,0.16313213703099513,35.52988394842021,0.09090909090909091,0.875359623015873,0.0,0.6097700543263379,0.295962228321436,0.8043807148933411,0.12244897959183673,0.16544471361400423,30.35813980848962,0.08461538461538462,1.0,0.0,0.5824832423969551,0.30365391478214765,0.7745898365974426,0.1258741258741259,0.07000236406619385,15.652541916029113,0.041586073500967116,1.0,0.0,0.524942233852627,0.2868635602207816,0.7825456261634827,0.1322314049586777,0.09370760233918128,18.97667180843942,0.045563549160671464,1.0,0.0,0.5289411213358536,0.28947643713509175,0.8264551162719727,0.20833333333333334,0.2543647167466844,40.917050935731844,0.11304347826086956,0.7881510416666666,0.0,0.645251240581274,0.3167145620398212,0.7741779685020447,0.10526315789473685,0.06748460666635736,14.027941854389159,0.03290676416819013,1.0,0.0,0.5226756495937623,0.28629111279921604,0.7822577953338623,0.11627906976744186,0.08367291803844507,17.19152706722311,0.03644646924829157,1.0,0.0,0.5286486184045877,0.29006646674435477,0.8183910846710205,0.10204081632653061,0.22626237623762385,37.652122732223255,0.09130434782608696,0.9457465277777778,0.0,0.6119822017524553,0.30529741433059226,0.7657070159912109,0.12618296529968454,0.06897509622434016,13.277570410903724,0.03468697123519458,1.0,0.0,0.519043401606642,0.2783756461250551,0.7753530144691467,0.1317829457364341,0.08248399471290169,16.695388960802457,0.04065934065934066,1.0,0.0,0.5308404759474072,0.2854537419355721,0.8155921697616577,0.21621621621621623,0.20956190188700946,36.71478359764598,0.124,0.907638888888889,0.0,0.6051083189599654,0.3053223031641488,0.8069922924041748,0.17989417989417988,0.122650228827835,23.693275412842237,0.06105610561056106,1.0,0.0,0.6058534290374181,0.3096912551235132,0.7773977518081665,0.1032258064516129,0.10855054791100548,21.83898587396978,0.05021834061135371,1.0,0.0,0.5291722127619911,0.27257462367789614
gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Selective or Routine Histology of Cholecystectomy Specimens for Diagnosing Incidental Carcinoma of Gallbladder and Correlation with Careful Intraoperative Macroscopic Examination? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Selective or Routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens for benign gallbladder disease has always been a matter of debate because of the low prevalence and bad prognosis associated with gall bladder carcinoma. The objective of this study is to ascertain whether selective histology can be preferred over Routine histology without any harm.

METHODS:
This systematic review is conducted according to PRISMA's checklist; relevant articles were searched in the database until September 1 2020 in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, manually, with search queries and without date restrictions. Studies included in this systematic review involved patients who underwent cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease and were diagnosed with gallbladder carcinoma incidentally either after selective or routine histology of the gallbladder.

RESULTS:
A total of 24 routine or selective histology recommending studies were selected for the systematic review after following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies comprised 77,213 numbers of patients and 486 numbers of Malignancies. These studies correlate the number of IGBC diagnosed histologically with the number of IGBC's that were suspected by the surgeons intraoperative by macroscopy. Routine recommending studies show a significant number of IGBC diagnosed histologically as missed by surgeons whereas the selective recommending studies show most of the histologically diagnosed IGBC already suspected by the surgeons intraoperative. When comparing the macroscopic details of the IGBC's between routine and selective studies, we found that there was significant overlap. Most of the findings missed by the surgeons as suspicious in routine studies were suspected by the surgeons involved in selective histology recommending studies. Thereby, favouring selective histology and emphasizing the need for careful intraoperative macroscopy for suspecting IGBC.

CONCLUSION:
Selective Histological examination of cholecystectomy specimens can be preferred if a careful intraoperative macroscopic examination is done and patient risk factors are taken into consideration.",Selective or Routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens for benign gallbladder disease has always been a matter of debate because of the low prevalence and bad prognosis associated with gall bladder carcinoma.

Selective Histological examination of cholecystectomy specimens can be preferred if a careful intraoperative macroscopic examination is done and patient risk factors are taken into consideration."," The diagnosis of incidental gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and its correlation with intraoperative macroscopic examination has been explored in various studies. A large retrospective study of 14,369 patients found that almost all cases of invasive GBC showed macroscopic abnormalities and suggested selective histology only when macroscopic examination raises suspicion [3]. Another study with 1122 cholecystectomies found that macroscopic examination revealed abnormal lesions in some cases, but histological examination was necessary to confirm the diagnosis [7]. A study of 10 patients with GBC suggested that early GBC can be managed successfully by simple cholecystectomy [8]. However, a study of 1162 patients found that macroscopic examination alone missed several cases of GBC and suggested the need for frozen section analysis [5]. Studies also noted that xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) can mimic GBC, leading to extensive surgeries [1, 6, 9, 11, 12]. A study of 142 cases of XGC found that neither clinical manifestations and laboratory tests nor radiological methods provide a practical and effective standard in differentiating between XGC and GBC [11].

TL;DR: While intraoperative macroscopic examination can identify some cases of gallbladder carcinoma, histological examination is often necessary for definitive diagnosis. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis can mimic gallbladder carcinoma, further complicating diagnosis.

This involves the examination of the gallbladder tissue removed during a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal surgery) under a microscope to identify any abnormal cells that may indicate cancer. 

The correlation with careful intraoperative macroscopic examination refers to the visual inspection of the gallbladder during surgery. Surgeons look for any visible signs of disease or abnormalities. However, not all cancers can be detected this way, especially in early stages. 

Studies have shown that routine histological examination can increase the detection rate of incidental gallbladder carcinoma, as some cases may be missed during macroscopic examination. However, the practice of routine histology is not universally adopted due to cost and resource implications. 

In conclusion, both selective and routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens can be effective in diagnosing incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder, but routine histology may detect more cases.

This involves examining specific areas of the specimen that appear abnormal or suspicious during intraoperative macroscopic examination. Routine histology, on the other hand, involves examining the entire specimen regardless of macroscopic findings. The correlation between careful intraoperative macroscopic examination and histological diagnosis is important for accurate detection and diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma.","The papers address the question of whether selective or routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens is more effective for diagnosing incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder. Sangwan 2015 and Alabi 2021 suggest that routine histopathology of all cholecystectomy specimens is necessary for early diagnosis and management of incidental carcinoma of the gallbladder. Deng 2015 argues that selective histologic examination for gallbladder specimens based on preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings is justified, while Khan 2022 recommends detailed intraoperative examination of cholecystectomy specimens for suspecting incidental gallbladder carcinoma at the earliest.

Results demonstrated that routine histological examination could detect malignancies in the gallbladder and that careful intraoperative macroscopic examination of gallbladder tissue can be useful when predicting the likelihood of gallbladder cancer.",0.8061233162879944,0.18269230769230768,0.3123831969766186,50.21515035707203,0.08361774744027303,0.7176788331321778,0.0,0.6468302577432959,0.3054017244002149,0.7923909425735474,0.1949685534591195,0.24868861685224508,40.18816979710857,0.1020671834625323,0.8973946409336009,0.0,0.5962318903015505,0.30007831487626285,0.7830537557601929,0.14076246334310852,0.17045478679821857,35.83808820048009,0.06344086021505377,1.0,0.0,0.5606009200969829,0.29398546773465606,0.7863702178001404,0.14147909967845657,0.18187778808126423,38.74970040966533,0.06997455470737914,0.9940337224383917,0.0,0.5721248206295986,0.2953771916905904,0.7588569521903992,0.058823529411764705,0.18090765973617065,33.910751714500684,0.027303754266211604,0.8342766183233109,0.0,0.5781249193281963,0.2647192394458444,0.7816294431686401,0.15656565656565657,0.14991444931333575,31.286249089208233,0.05872193436960276,1.0,0.0,0.5587621759423005,0.2933191167727003,0.7798286080360413,0.14860681114551083,0.1830154745780582,36.9929067395379,0.07194244604316546,1.0,0.0,0.5661416391351006,0.29111727683830774,0.7708578109741211,0.12206572769953052,0.21403091557669443,36.05964292912554,0.052901023890784986,0.7928561676564954,0.0,0.5715215225582537,0.2752777227209246,0.7954162359237671,0.15488215488215487,0.20423386830859597,41.881491688649376,0.0947075208913649,0.9189427668634866,0.0,0.5947288241463177,0.30488143367829745,0.7949855327606201,0.16541353383458648,0.23487580694395768,43.730902209868454,0.09897610921501707,0.7470309722822693,0.0,0.5908157164451635,0.3031304248842795,0.7878918051719666,0.1286549707602339,0.2976580796252928,38.926024377245874,0.04436860068259386,0.8159427195002515,0.0,0.6813974007964134,0.28822240770901997,0.7920909523963928,0.15267175572519084,0.23152796770721434,42.46257811988016,0.09556313993174062,0.8240021516994717,0.0,0.6197940728262715,0.301955447139927,0.7982293963432312,0.16730038022813687,0.27227678726852833,44.50514566922818,0.12116040955631399,0.9446592556371682,0.0,0.6174716819510904,0.30274634920812576
gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Does high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ of the biliary duct margin affect the prognosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/CIS) of the biliary duct margin was found to not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by recent studies, but it has not yet reached a conclusion.

METHODS:
Eligible studies were searched by PubMed, PMC, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from Jan. 1, 2000 to Jun. 30, 2019, investigating the influences of surgical margin status of biliary duct on the prognosis of patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Overall survival (OS) and local recurrence were evaluated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

RESULTS:
A total of 11 studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis, including 1734 patients in the R0 group, 194 patients in the HGD/CIS group, and 229 patients in the invasive carcinoma (INV) group. The pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.65~1.50), 1.01 (95% CI 0.73~1.41), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.72~1.34), respectively. The pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 1.83 (95% CI 1.09~3.06), 4.52 (95% CI 2.20~9.26), and 3.74 (95% CI 2.34~5.96), respectively. Subgroup analysis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma at early stage showed that the pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 0.54 (95% CI 0.21~1.36), 0.75 (95% CI 0.35~1.58), and 0.74 (95% CI 0.40~1.37), respectively, and the pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 3.47 (95% CI 1.09~11.02), 9.12 (95% CI 2.98~27.93), and 9.17 (95% CI 2.95~28.55), respectively. However, the pooled OR for the incidence of local recurrence between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 3.54 (95% CI 1.66~7.53), and the pooled OR for the incidence of local recurrence between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 0.93 (95% CI 0.50~1.74).

CONCLUSION:
With the current data, we concluded that HGD/CIS would increase the risk of local recurrence compared with R0, although it did not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma regardless of TNM stage. However, the conclusion needs to be furtherly confirmed.","High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/CIS) of the biliary duct margin was found to not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by recent studies, but it has not yet reached a conclusion.","Eligible studies were searched by PubMed, PMC, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from Jan. 1, 2000 to Jun. 30, 2019, investigating the influences of surgical margin status of biliary duct on the prognosis of patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ refers to the presence of abnormal cells that have not invaded beyond the inner lining of the biliary duct. If high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ is present at the margin of the biliary duct in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, it indicates a more advanced stage of the disease and may be associated with a worse prognosis. The presence of high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ at the biliary duct margin suggests a higher likelihood of local recurrence and a potential for the spread of cancer cells beyond the primary tumor site.

","Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with positive margins, invasive disease, or carcinoma in situ of the biliary duct margin may affect the prognosis due to its anatomic location and lack of response to medical treatment. Surgical exploration via laparoscopy may be necessary as a way to properly stage the tumor. Surgery as a form of treatment is often used for effective resection of the tumor, depending on the location. The perihilar subtype of cholangiocarcinoma, also known as Klatskin tumor, may need extensive resection which may involve the resection of part of the liver and extrahepatic bile duct. Liver transplantation is also controversial and a treatment option, however, long-term follow-up is recommended for those with multiple biliary duct hamartomas due to the potential risk of malignant transformation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma.",0.7926984429359436,0.13872832369942198,0.1340845562543676,17.459643098369824,0.06968641114982578,1.0,0.0,0.5738843371610687,0.3062970790971128,0.8148442506790161,0.1724137931034483,0.15742090486988444,28.150357588213552,0.09248554913294797,1.0,0.0,0.589671135994426,0.3099432585667552,0.7697767615318298,0.13574660633484162,0.08458079425358414,13.103817984768984,0.04212860310421286,1.0,0.0,0.5051610523284076,0.28875128022886065,0.7783690690994263,0.13872832369942198,0.10112274313457745,17.26948439559023,0.05187319884726225,1.0,0.0,0.5164317610528734,0.2947323978207675,0.8322452902793884,0.24390243902439024,0.23489238410596025,32.849641251150565,0.10752688172043011,0.9073305670816045,0.0,0.6459991390436468,0.32353957714014187,0.7710880637168884,0.10256410256410256,0.06958225526890904,12.55119407276174,0.03803131991051454,1.0,0.0,0.5036503989912545,0.281330456901928,0.7709840536117554,0.11940298507462686,0.08353676913803496,14.133722937068294,0.04289544235924933,1.0,0.0,0.503782297883715,0.28184250779363823,0.8458186388015747,0.1791044776119403,0.2159675658818026,40.46693745336325,0.0949367088607595,0.6975103734439834,0.0,0.6795922638132021,0.33138386345039966,0.7619922161102295,0.13333333333333336,0.10240848615128756,11.87049296880786,0.054285714285714284,1.0,0.0,0.5087480209358446,0.28846989358125247,0.772711992263794,0.12444444444444443,0.1163243314567206,15.123373977004947,0.06521739130434782,1.0,0.0,0.5193993035167785,0.29804117243055495,0.8486601114273071,0.2553191489361702,0.30128893662728246,35.89862647865609,0.17073170731707318,1.0,0.0,0.6544671773233197,0.33679417585061744,0.8397661447525024,0.19653179190751446,0.1699168585778983,22.151012099610607,0.156140350877193,1.0,0.0,0.6108775804949622,0.3382504716241216,0.7839760184288025,0.11976047904191617,0.09889700143944782,15.60300249032929,0.043010752688172046,1.0,0.0,0.5417339588279155,0.2837913611127067
gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Does aerobic exercise reduce NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Exercise is an effective strategy for the prevention and regression of hepatic steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it is unclear whether it can reduce advanced stages of NAFLD, i.e., steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, it is not evident which modality of exercise is optimal to improve/attenuate NAFLD.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim is to systematically review evidence for the effect of aerobic exercise (AE) on NAFLD, in particular non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and Embase. Studies were screened and included according to predefined criteria, data were extracted, and the quality was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias tools by two researchers independently according to the protocol registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021270059). Meta-analyses were performed using a bivariate random-effects model when there were at least three randomized intervention studies (RCTs) with similar intervention modalities and outcome.

RESULTS:
The systematic review process resulted in an inclusion a total of 24 studies, 18 RCTs and six non-RCTs, encompassing 1014 patients with NAFLD diagnosed by histological or radiological findings. Studies were grouped based on the type of AE: moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). A total of twelve meta-analyses were conducted. Compared to controls, MICT resulted in a mean difference (MD) in the NAFLD biomarkers alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of -3.59 (CI: -5.60, -1.59, p<0.001) and -4.05 (CI: -6.39, -1.71, p<0.001), respectively. HIIT resulted in a MD of -4.31 (95% CI: -9.03, 0.41, p=0.07) and 1.02 (95% CI: -6.91, 8.94, p=0.8) for ALT and AST, respectively. Moreover, both AE types compared to controls showed a significantly lower magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) determined liver fat with a MD of -5.19 (95% CI: -7.33, -3.04, p<0.001) and -3.41 (95% CI: -4.74, -2.08, p<0.001), for MICT and HIIT respectively. MICT compared to controls resulted in a significantly higher cardiorespiratory fitness (MD: 4.43, 95% CI: 0.31, 8.55, p=0.03).

CONCLUSION:
Liver fat is decreased by AE with a concomitant decrease of liver enzymes. AE improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of different types of AE on hepatic inflammation andÂ fibrosis.

An animal study [2] showed that exercise training provided some improvement in NASH-related outcomes, including fibrosis markers and inflammation, but did not lead to complete resolution of the NASH phenotype. A longitudinal study on 73 NAFLD patients [5] showed that those who lost weight or reported increased physical activity had significant reductions in liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores, suggesting improvement in NAFLD severity. A large multicenter retrospective study involving 11,690 NAFLD subjects [10] showed that physical activity above 600 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-min/week was independently associated with a reduced risk of fibrosis, sarcopenia, high probability of ASCVD, and high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. However, several review articles [1], [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], [11], [12] highlight the importance of lifestyle interventions, including diet and physical activity, in managing NAFLD but do not provide specific evidence on the effects of aerobic exercise on NASH and liver fibrosis.

TL;DR: While some studies suggest that physical activity, including aerobic exercise, can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

Several studies emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications, including physical activity, in managing NAFLD [1,4,11,16]. A randomized control trial found that high-intensity exercise led to significant improvement in steatosis and fibrosis compared to the control group, with the moderate-intensity exercise group also showing significant decreases in serum aminotransferases [14]. A post hoc analysis of the NASHFit trial found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise led to a significant improvement in serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, which may contribute to the observed reduction in liver fat and improvement in serum biomarkers of liver fibrosis in NASH patients who exercise [5]. An animal study also showed that moderate intensity exercise training improved the histological features of NASH, including fibrosis markers and inflammation [3]. However, a systematic review of 11 studies in cirrhotic patients and one study in liver transplant recipients found improvements in peak oxygen consumption and six-minute walk test performance, but did not provide evidence of reductions in mortality rates before and after transplantation [2]. 

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may improve markers of NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, but more robust and large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal exercise regimens.

Several studies have demonstrated that regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, or cycling, can improve liver health by reducing liver fat accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Aerobic exercise helps to increase insulin sensitivity, promote weight loss, and improve lipid profiles, all of which are beneficial for patients with NAFLD. However, it is important to note that the specific duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise required to achieve these benefits may vary among individuals and should be tailored to each patient's capabilities and medical condition. It is recommended that patients with NAFLD consult with their healthcare provider or a qualified exercise specialist to develop an appropriate exercise program.","The papers suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Houttu 2022 conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies and found that moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) both reduced liver fat and liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD. Hashida 2017 found that both aerobic and resistance exercise reduced hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients, but resistance exercise required less energy consumption and may be more feasible for patients with poor cardiorespiratory fitness. Jia 2018 found that a combination of resistance and aerobic exercises was more effective in improving the metabolic state of NAFLD patients. Bacchi 2013 found that both resistance and aerobic training were equally effective in reducing hepatic fat content in type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD. Overall, the papers suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, and a combination of resistance and aerobic exercises may be more effective."," The articles provided offer mixed evidence on the impact of aerobic exercise on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). An animal study [2] showed that exercise training provided some improvement in NASH-related outcomes, including fibrosis markers and inflammation, but did not lead to complete resolution of the NASH phenotype. A longitudinal study on 73 NAFLD patients [5] showed that those who lost weight or reported increased physical activity had significant reductions in liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores, suggesting improvement in NAFLD severity. A large multicenter retrospective study involving 11,690 NAFLD subjects [10] showed that physical activity above 600 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-min/week was independently associated with a reduced risk of fibrosis, sarcopenia, high probability of ASCVD, and high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. However, several review articles [1], [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], [11], [12] highlight the importance of lifestyle interventions, including diet and physical activity, in managing NAFLD but do not provide specific evidence on the effects of aerobic exercise on NASH and liver fibrosis.

"," While some studies suggest that physical activity, including aerobic exercise, can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The literature on the impact of aerobic exercise on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is varied. Several studies emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications, including physical activity, in managing NAFLD [1,4,11,16]. A randomized control trial found that high-intensity exercise led to significant improvement in steatosis and fibrosis compared to the control group, with the moderate-intensity exercise group also showing significant decreases in serum aminotransferases [14]. A post hoc analysis of the NASHFit trial found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise led to a significant improvement in serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, which may contribute to the observed reduction in liver fat and improvement in serum biomarkers of liver fibrosis in NASH patients who exercise [5]. An animal study also showed that moderate intensity exercise training improved the histological features of NASH, including fibrosis markers and inflammation [3]. However, a systematic review of 11 studies in cirrhotic patients and one study in liver transplant recipients found improvements in peak oxygen consumption and six-minute walk test performance, but did not provide evidence of reductions in mortality rates before and after transplantation [2]. 

"," Current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may improve markers of NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, but more robust and large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal exercise regimens.

"," The evidence suggests that lifestyle modifications, including aerobic exercise and weight loss, can improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as reduce liver fat content and fibrosis [1][6][10][14][19]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies, including 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 6 non-RCTs, involving 1014 patients with NAFLD, found that moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) significantly reduced NAFLD biomarkers and liver fat [16]. However, the impact of different types of aerobic exercise on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis requires further research [7][16]. In an animal study, moderate intensity exercise training and modest energy restriction resulted in some improvement in the histological features of NASH, but did not lead to complete resolution of the NASH phenotype [12]. Further, a study found that exercise training significantly improved serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 levels, which was associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with NASH [9].

"," Current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise can improve NAFLD and NASH and reduce liver fat content, but more research is needed to understand its specific impact on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.

","Aerobic exercise is recommended to reduce the risk of NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Weight loss of 3 to 5% in those with simple steatosis and 7 to 10% in those with NASH has been shown to improve their condition. Statins, vitamin E, and thiazolidinediones are also sometimes prescribed to help lower the risk of progression to more serious liver disease. Additionally, bariatric surgery as a treatment option is available for patients with morbid obesity. Obeticholic acid may also be prescribed, however, it is not FDA approved for treating NAFLD or NASH. Evidence suggests that OCA at 25mg/day or 40mg/day can improve fibrosis and histological components of NASH. Follow up studies are necessary to determine the clinical benefit of OCA in patients with NASH.",0.7249547243118286,0.13385826771653545,0.1528987130193814,27.261092734966162,0.07859531772575251,0.9791237457573806,0.0,0.5258026489189693,0.24956066839419144,0.7214800119400024,0.1382488479262673,0.16726943942133818,30.27534555385307,0.0724907063197026,0.8378685668267696,0.0,0.533424697757706,0.2464857463432447,0.7510120868682861,0.1282798833819242,0.11650114591291062,22.62479360938141,0.05515370705244123,1.0,0.0,0.5445065200328827,0.27220002150189887,0.7489836812019348,0.1442622950819672,0.12652507907817442,25.06387453627411,0.058315334773218146,1.0,0.0,0.5519006840857981,0.272908737000636,0.7205252647399902,0.10126582278481013,0.16898608349900598,26.578112574115124,0.03345724907063197,0.8060288335517694,0.0,0.5817300645594902,0.23482822186512348,0.7671989798545837,0.14565826330532214,0.146213392437852,23.349826672469103,0.07309941520467836,1.0,0.0,0.5654237686116018,0.2875846579182891,0.7671802639961243,0.15047021943573666,0.15333013895543843,25.558458122266554,0.0765661252900232,1.0,0.0,0.574287881163785,0.28909171600022165,0.7306289672851562,0.10126582278481013,0.22785064239828692,28.667653290066,0.03903345724907063,0.799475753604194,0.0,0.5989793393346998,0.24663945056725214,0.7748296856880188,0.17610062893081763,0.17668806771597365,28.941079386938313,0.10309278350515463,1.0,0.0,0.5806753620845099,0.29634720490615885,0.7724578976631165,0.18947368421052632,0.20257496960522095,32.07371253427189,0.11192214111922141,1.0,0.0,0.5810683987295354,0.296176853739293,0.7562860250473022,0.14379084967320263,0.27167017111368913,33.34734193612525,0.055762081784386616,0.9097405732847548,0.0,0.7012232884764671,0.2715122730519634,0.7571338415145874,0.1543859649122807,0.20648478293931763,26.73972639079953,0.08405797101449275,1.0,0.0,0.5680924020707607,0.28041712927564677,0.7357219457626343,0.16406250000000003,0.17136795781157324,28.611313480802796,0.07859531772575251,0.9284076015727392,0.0,0.5408665256096366,0.262206071120071
gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation: treatment or observation? Results of a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Optimal treatment of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) during liver transplantation (LT) remains debated. We systematically reviewed the literature on definitions, treatment and outcomes of patients presenting SPSS undergoing LT.

METHODS:
According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we used PubMed to retrieve all studies dealing with SPSS and LT between January 1987 and January 2020. The primary endpoints were definitions and outcomes according to the management of SPSS (treatment vs observation).

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies detailing the management of 962 SPSS were retrieved. Hemodynamically significant SPSS were defined as those having diameterââ¥â10Â mm in 41% (nâ=â395) of patients. SPSS were splenorenal (42%), cavo-gastric (15.2%), umbilical (7.4%), mesenterico-caval (nâ=â31; 3.2%), mesenterico-renal (0.1%) and unreported (31.9%), respectively. At the time of LT 372 shunts (38.7%) were treated while 590 were observed (61.3%). During a follow-up time ranging from 4Â months to 5Â years, the reported overall survival (OS) at 1Â year was not significantly different except for one study. Portal vein anastomosis complications (i.e. reduced flow, stenosis or thrombosis) were similarly reported in observed [nâ=â26 (4%)] and ligated SPSS [nâ=â10 (2%)] (pâ=â0.22) but the rate of relaparotomy was significantly higher in observed SPPS (16 vs 2; pâ=â0.01) to rescue post LT portal vein thrombosis (nâ=â6) and reduced portal flow and graft dysfunction (nâ=â10).

CONCLUSIONS:
There was a heterogeneous management of SPSS during LT in the literature. Ligation of SPPS did not reduce vascular complications neither improved survival. A randomized prospective study might contribute to identify best management of SPSS at time of LT.","Optimal treatment of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) during liver transplantation (LT) remains debated.

A randomized prospective study might contribute to identify best management of SPSS at time of LT.," Abernethy malformation is a rare condition involving portomesenteric blood bypassing the liver and draining into the systemic vein through a shunt, which may require liver transplantation or shunt occlusion for symptomatic patients [1]. Portosystemic shunts are also mentioned as potential treatment options for hepatic hydrothorax in cirrhotic patients [2]. Congenital portosystemic shunts can present in various ways, and further research is needed for their management [3]. A case study of a cirrhosis patient with a large spontaneous portosystemic shunt (SPSS) who underwent liver transplantation and had the shunt closed during surgery showed a successful outcome [4]. Congenital portosystemic shunts can lead to complications if left untreated [5]. If a congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS) remains open, radiologic or surgical closure may be necessary [6]. A retrospective review of children and young adults with CPSS found that some underwent successful CPSS occlusion/ligation or liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [7]. An observational study of patients with congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEPS) or Abernethy malformation found that shunt closure improved, stabilized, or cured CEPS manifestations [8].

TL;DR: There is evidence to suggest that management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation could involve treatment such as shunt closure, which has been associated with successful outcomes, although the strength of the evidence varies and further research is needed [4,8].

Chen et al. [3] found that neither the size nor type of SPSS significantly impacted mortality, morbidity, or liver function recovery following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). However, they did find that patients with a large splenorenal shunt (SRS) had a higher incidence of portal complications. Similarly, a study by Perfecto et al. [4] found that the closure of nonsplenorenal SPSS resulted in an improvement in portal flow, with all but one patient alive after a mean follow-up of 5.18 years. On the other hand, a retrospective study by Garcia-Tsao et al. [10] found no statistical difference in overall patient survival or graft survival between patients without SPSS or with small or large SPSSs, suggesting that no steps to correct SPSS intraoperatively are necessary. Miranda et al. [13] found no significant difference in the 1- and 5-year overall survival rates between patients who had their SPSS ligated and those who didn't. Golse et al. [15] found that both splenectomy and left renal vein ligation were effective in avoiding vascular steal in the presence of SRS. 

TL;DR: The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation depends on individual patient characteristics and the specific type and size of the shunt. Both observation and treatment (including shunt closure and ligation) have been associated with positive outcomes in certain contexts. However, more research is needed to establish clear guidelines for the best approach.

Another retrospective study of 346 cirrhotic patients found that total shunt area exceeding 78.54 mm2 was associated with increased risk of early allograft dysfunction, acute kidney injury, clinically relevant complications, 12-month graft loss, and patient death following liver transplantation [11]. A retrospective study of 23 patients found that closure of nonsplenorenal SPSS resulted in improved portal flow and survival, although complications were observed [12]. A case series of five patients showed that endovascular techniques could be used to manage portal steal syndrome due to large SPSS, with graft functions normalizing in four patients [13]. The management of congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) can involve radiologic or surgical closure to prevent or resolve complications [15].

TL;DR: The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation can involve observation, ligation, or closure, with studies showing varied outcomes. The decision should be based on individual patient characteristics and shunt properties, such as size and location. Further research is needed to establish best practices.

In some cases, treatment may be necessary to address the shunt and prevent complications. This can involve surgical ligation or embolization of the shunt to redirect blood flow. However, in certain situations where the shunt is small and not causing significant symptoms or complications, observation without immediate intervention may be considered.

"," There is evidence to suggest that management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation could involve treatment such as shunt closure, which has been associated with successful outcomes, although the strength of the evidence varies and further research is needed [4,8].

"," The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) at the time of liver transplantation is a topic of ongoing research, with varying findings and recommendations. Chen et al. [3] found that neither the size nor type of SPSS significantly impacted mortality, morbidity, or liver function recovery following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). However, they did find that patients with a large splenorenal shunt (SRS) had a higher incidence of portal complications. Similarly, a study by Perfecto et al. [4] found that the closure of nonsplenorenal SPSS resulted in an improvement in portal flow, with all but one patient alive after a mean follow-up of 5.18 years. On the other hand, a retrospective study by Garcia-Tsao et al. [10] found no statistical difference in overall patient survival or graft survival between patients without SPSS or with small or large SPSSs, suggesting that no steps to correct SPSS intraoperatively are necessary. Miranda et al. [13] found no significant difference in the 1- and 5-year overall survival rates between patients who had their SPSS ligated and those who didn't. Golse et al. [15] found that both splenectomy and left renal vein ligation were effective in avoiding vascular steal in the presence of SRS. 

"," The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation depends on individual patient characteristics and the specific type and size of the shunt. Both observation and treatment (including shunt closure and ligation) have been associated with positive outcomes in certain contexts. However, more research is needed to establish clear guidelines for the best approach.

"," The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) at the time of liver transplantation is a complex issue with no consensus in the literature. A systematic review involving 962 SPSS cases found that at the time of transplantation, 38.7% of shunts were treated while 61.3% were observed. There was no significant difference in overall survival at 1 year between the treated and observed groups, except for in one study [4]. A retrospective study of 231 patients found no significant difference in the 1- and 5-year overall survival rates between patients who had SPSS ligated and those who did not [6]. Another retrospective study of 346 cirrhotic patients found that total shunt area exceeding 78.54 mm2 was associated with increased risk of early allograft dysfunction, acute kidney injury, clinically relevant complications, 12-month graft loss, and patient death following liver transplantation [11]. A retrospective study of 23 patients found that closure of nonsplenorenal SPSS resulted in improved portal flow and survival, although complications were observed [12]. A case series of five patients showed that endovascular techniques could be used to manage portal steal syndrome due to large SPSS, with graft functions normalizing in four patients [13]. The management of congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) can involve radiologic or surgical closure to prevent or resolve complications [15].

"," The management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation can involve observation, ligation, or closure, with studies showing varied outcomes. The decision should be based on individual patient characteristics and shunt properties, such as size and location. Further research is needed to establish best practices.

","Patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures require close clinical multidisciplinary follow-ups and regular ultrasound scans to monitor their liver function. The purpose of this type of surgery is to allow for decompression of gastroesophageal varices and portal system. The selection of the procedure should be done based on assessment of hepatic function of the patient prior to surgery as well as patency of the portal and splenic veins. When medical management fails, surgical/interventional management includes placement of a shunt that redirects the portal blood into the systemic circulation. In terms of the management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation, it is still unclear whether treatment or observation should be chosen. Thus more studies are required to have certainty on the best practice.",0.7460839152336121,0.1282051282051282,0.07601351351351351,15.280415844074865,0.03614457831325301,1.0,0.0,0.48120256411294415,0.25971902425028914,0.7435183525085449,0.12244897959183673,0.09523043762836572,15.922002006915623,0.03524229074889868,1.0,0.0,0.4859387064483804,0.2625884256310712,0.7273196578025818,0.1081081081081081,0.04568106312292359,10.081660217091082,0.024667931688804556,1.0,0.0,0.4264871835624192,0.2499041533730126,0.7167044878005981,0.08490566037735849,0.044018643190056966,11.001897903619854,0.021377672209026127,1.0,0.0,0.4256933338658507,0.2427253090692988,0.777864933013916,0.19277108433734938,0.11410788381742738,27.10758450653851,0.07368421052631578,0.8778220451527224,0.0,0.527701568969509,0.27226726780094906,0.7540324330329895,0.09966777408637874,0.04877167630057803,10.263592882871958,0.023887973640856673,1.0,0.0,0.46110231573410454,0.27158911256279594,0.7535841464996338,0.09917355371900827,0.06439168591224019,12.620885130083744,0.02748414376321353,1.0,0.0,0.46486357417139973,0.2713518521780074,0.7831074595451355,0.1263157894736842,0.12335526315789473,23.29851404103803,0.06504065040650407,1.0,0.0,0.5542605657812575,0.2875247202096196,0.7586724758148193,0.12459016393442623,0.06473466091389891,10.058967264619419,0.03079416531604538,1.0,0.0,0.4695588223738213,0.2750266860369302,0.7589524388313293,0.12549019607843137,0.06627552246341767,12.196500358845388,0.03707414829659319,1.0,0.0,0.4744370837239611,0.274864203956085,0.7810167074203491,0.13953488372093023,0.1789521778860798,25.534194043542747,0.06542056074766354,1.0,0.0,0.5455931766379264,0.2839754994957351,0.787023663520813,0.16666666666666666,0.12598440969758018,19.036120903713556,0.05172413793103448,1.0,0.0,0.5124093767474679,0.282118187648078,0.7476931214332581,0.11904761904761905,0.09102893488448179,13.527549934986846,0.030685920577617327,1.0,0.0,0.47734837151236004,0.26162889018032137
gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Does the intermittent Pringle maneuver affect the recurrence following surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:
To evaluate the effect of intermittent pringle maneuver (IPM) on the long-term prognosis and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

METHODS:
Eligible studies were identified by PubMed and other databases from Jan 1st 1990 to Mar 31st 2019. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the effects of IPM on the long-term prognosis and recurrence of patients with HCC.

RESULTS:
Six studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Results showed that there were no differences between IPM group and non-IPM group in the pooled HRs for the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.84~1.28, P = 0.74; HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.81~1.07, P = 0.29; respectively). However, subgroup analysis showed that the pooled Odd ratios (OR) for the 1-year OS and DFS rates of the IPM group when compared with the non-IPM group were 0.65 (95% CI 0.45~0.94, P = 0.02), 0.38 (95% CI 0.20~0.72, P = 0.003), respectively. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportions of liver cirrhosis, HBsAg (+), Child-Pugh A class, multiple tumor, vascular invasion, and major hepatectomy between groups of IPM and non-IPM.

CONCLUSION:
Since IPM would increase the risk of early-recurrence, it should be used cautiously in the procedure of hepatectomy for resectable HCC. However, the current conclusion needs further validation.

A large retrospective study of 2,368 patients found that a Pringle maneuver time greater than 15 minutes was an independent predictor of HCC recurrence [3]. Similarly, another study of 357 patients indicated that a Pringle time of more than 60 minutes was associated with shorter overall survival [10].

It involves clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament to temporarily occlude the blood flow to the liver. This maneuver helps to reduce blood loss during the surgery. 

There is limited evidence regarding the effect of the intermittent Pringle maneuver on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following surgical resection. Some studies suggest that the use of the Pringle maneuver may be associated with a higher risk of tumor recurrence, while others report no significant difference in recurrence rates compared to surgeries without the maneuver. 

It is important to note that the decision to use the intermittent Pringle maneuver during liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma is based on various factors, including the surgeon's experience and judgment, the patient's overall health, and the extent of the tumor. The potential benefits and risks of using the maneuver should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.","The effect of the Pringle maneuver (PM) on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgical resection is controversial.

Similarly, a retrospective study involving 142 patients found no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who underwent IPM and those who underwent continuous Pringle maneuver [1]. Another study involving 441 patients also found no significant difference in overall survival or disease-free survival between patients who underwent IPM and those who did not [14]. However, a larger retrospective study involving 2368 patients found that a Pringle maneuver time greater than 15 minutes was an independent predictor of HCC recurrence [11]. Moreover, a study involving 1401 patients found that in stage IIIB HCC patients, those who received long-term hepatic pedicle clamping had significantly higher overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates compared to those with short-term hepatic pedicle clamping [19]. 

"," Current evidence suggests that the intermittent Pringle maneuver does not significantly affect the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following surgical resection. However, the duration of the Pringle maneuver may be a significant factor, with longer durations potentially associated with better outcomes in certain patient populations. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

"," The use of the Pringle maneuver (PM) during liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been examined across multiple studies with mixed findings. Some studies suggest that longer durations of PM may be associated with an increased risk of HCC recurrence [1, 13, 18]. However, a meta-analysis of one randomized controlled trial and 18 non-randomized studies involving 7,480 patients found no evidence that PM negatively affects recurrence-free or overall survival rates [2]. Another meta-analysis also reported no significant differences between intermittent PM (IPM) and non-IPM groups in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival, although caution was suggested due to the potential for early recurrence [3]. Other studies have reported no significant difference in overall survival and recurrence-free survival between patients who underwent PM and those who did not [10, 16]. Some studies suggest that PM can reduce intraoperative bleeding and associated complications [4, 10]. 

"," Current evidence is mixed and does not conclusively establish whether the intermittent Pringle maneuver affects the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following surgical resection. Further research is needed to clarify these findings.

","No studies have been done to determine if the intermittent Pringle maneuver affects recurrence following resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Surgery is the only curative approach for most patients, but not all patients are candidates due to advanced stage of the disease or liver disease. For resectable cases, the relapse-free survival rate is 40% and 5-year OS is 90%, but mortality rate is 5-10%. Transplant candidates are evaluated according to the Milan criteria plus High MELD-Na score and the relapse-free survival rate is 80% with 4-year OS of 75%. Bridge therapies are available while waiting for transplant such as chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or partial hepatectomy, but neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are not considered a standard of care. Pringle maneuver is used to determine the source of intraabdominal bleeding in trauma or elective hepatic surgeries, however it carries the risk of ischemia and portal hypertension and must not be clamped for more than 10 minutes at a time. Other temporary measures such as manual compression and peri-hepatic packing are available, but have a high mortality rate.",0.751519501209259,0.14285714285714288,0.20613643525937292,27.96984085201953,0.0779816513761468,1.0,0.0,0.5489149704851486,0.2676263048072535,0.7568203210830688,0.17117117117117117,0.18324607329842932,32.494794854431404,0.07581227436823104,0.8030765486187172,0.0,0.5546897400069881,0.26325571447857,0.7627137303352356,0.15469613259668508,0.15395412681748258,23.58192015540676,0.07578558225508318,1.0,0.0,0.5608541659572546,0.28397491844936706,0.7707854509353638,0.16161616161616163,0.17575940020590283,28.55652881439087,0.08397932816537468,1.0,0.0,0.5768071647025337,0.2869817014113091,0.7699436545372009,0.12972972972972974,0.22395527603074772,34.709982219309815,0.05956678700361011,0.7550200803212851,0.0,0.5841847811975787,0.2731791625378094,0.7747077941894531,0.1507246376811594,0.15363434104745496,24.037677879823594,0.07403651115618662,1.0,0.0,0.5686945550352613,0.29263142235799156,0.778938889503479,0.1512027491408935,0.1760492134308234,28.18439522625555,0.07816711590296496,1.0,0.0,0.5850677549596724,0.295902880744241,0.7621676325798035,0.11494252873563218,0.19870549597972004,34.82619472544932,0.04512635379061372,0.7546375980110919,0.0,0.5833818712404796,0.2674896204416568,0.8020472526550293,0.18831168831168832,0.18942942037032037,30.7390273430793,0.08872901678657075,1.0,0.0,0.5906197020050251,0.3072918676753435,0.8078703880310059,0.2109090909090909,0.21114522505167263,34.553164644850405,0.10495626822157435,1.0,0.0,0.6117328511220272,0.31262948330621887,0.749464750289917,0.06535947712418301,0.14942528735632182,30.234909904009342,0.010830324909747292,0.7951807228915663,0.0,0.5800062888198428,0.25269727196415137,0.8634724617004395,0.49645390070921985,0.36159508777496363,48.65683209885543,0.3919308357348703,0.6795486037718124,0.0,0.6971037135374077,0.36254408661036613,0.770075261592865,0.14521452145214522,0.14847068000263028,25.777918634672538,0.07178841309823678,1.0,0.0,0.549667956321749,0.2795522660943086
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Hypoalbuminemia and colorectal cancer patients: Any correlation?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
In malnourished patients with colorectal cancer, hypoalbuminemia is common and was proposed to determine the postoperative outcome of colorectal surgery. Mounting articles published but have not been evaluated. We aim to assess the predictive value of preoperative hypoalbuminemia in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

METHODS:
We performed a literature search from PubMed, Euro PMC, and Cochrane with the terms serum albumin, hypoalbuminemia, prognosis, outcome, colorectal cancer, and neoplasm. We also hand-searched and included any relevant papers. Hypoalbuminemia is defined as plasma albumin level < 3.5âmg/dL. We restricted the included studies to English language and adults undergoing colectomy, laparotomy, laparoscopy, or abdominoperineal resection. Any types of articles were included, except an abstract-only publication and those that did not report the key exposure or outcome of interest. The key exposures were mortality, hospitalization time, and morbid conditions (thrombosis, surgical site infection, sepsis, and wound events). We pooled the odds ratio from each included literature as effect size. The Newcastle Ottawa scale and GRADE were used to determine the quality of each included study.

RESULTS:
Hereof 7 observational studies (236,480 individuals) were included. Our meta-analysis found that preoperative hypoalbuminemia can predict the postoperative outcome in colorectal cancer patients. Individuals with hypoalbuminemia were not associated with 30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 2.05 [0.72, 5.86], P = .18, I2 = 99%) but were associated with morbidity (RR 2.28 [1.78, 2.93], P < .00001, I2 = 87.5%), surgical complication (RR 1.69 [1.34, 2.13], P < .00001, I2 = 98%), and hospitalization (RR 2.21 [1.93, 2.52], P < .00001, I2 = 0%). According to newcastle ottawa scale, the included studies are of moderate to sound quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
The current systematic review and meta-analysis showed that preoperative hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with morbidity, length of stay, and surgical complication but not mortality.","In malnourished patients with colorectal cancer, hypoalbuminemia is common and was proposed to determine the postoperative outcome of colorectal surgery.

preoperative hypoalbuminemia is significantly associated with morbidity, length of stay, and surgical complication but not mortality."," Hypoalbuminemia, or low levels of serum albumin, has been associated with negative outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, particularly those undergoing surgery. Several large-scale studies have demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with longer hospital stays, increased rates of complications, and poorer survival outcomes [2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15]. For example, a retrospective study of 7,072 CRC patients found that hypoalbuminemia was an independent predictor for overall complications and major complications following surgery [2]. Similarly, a study of 360 elderly CRC patients identified hypoalbuminemia as an independent risk factor for postoperative complications [7]. Another retrospective study of 30,676 CRC patients found that mild hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity [8]. Additionally, a retrospective cohort study of 795 CRC patients found that hypoalbuminemia was independently associated with poorer cancer-specific and overall survival [10]. However, some studies have not found a statistically significant association between hypoalbuminemia and CRC stage or postoperative complications [6].

TL;DR: There is strong evidence to suggest a correlation between hypoalbuminemia and negative outcomes in colorectal cancer, particularly in patients undergoing surgery. However, the relationship between hypoalbuminemia and colorectal cancer stage is less clear.

","At present, there is not currently a definitive correlation between hypoalbuminemia and colorectal cancer. However, hypoalbuminemia is a common finding in hospitalized individuals and is related to increased morbidity and mortality. It is particularly prevalent in critically ill and elderly patients, with some reports showing a prevalence of hypoalbuminemia of greater than 70% in elderly hospitalized patients.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Should we screen for colorectal cancer in people aged 75 and over? A systematic review - collaborative work of the French geriatric oncology society (SOFOG) and the French federation of digestive oncology (FFCD).,"BACKGROUND:
We have done a systematic literature review about CRC Screening over 75Â years old in order to update knowledge and make recommendations.

METHODS:
PUBMED database was searched in October 2021 for articles published on CRC screening in the elderly, and generated 249 articles. Further searches were made to find articles on the acceptability, efficacy, and harms of screening in this population, together with the state of international guidelines.

RESULTS:
Most benefit-risk data on CRC screening in the over 75Â s derived from simulation studies. Most guidelines recommend stopping cancer screening at the age of 75. In private health systems, extension of screening up to 80-85Â years is, based on the life expectancy and the history of screening. Screening remains effective in populations without comorbidity given their better life-expectancy. Serious adverse events of colonoscopy increase with age and can outweigh the benefit of screening. The great majority of reviews concluded that screening between 75 and 85Â years must be decided case by case.

CONCLUSION:
The current literature does not allow Evidence-Based Medicine propositions for mass screening above 75Â years old. As some subjects over 75Â years may benefit from CRC screening, we discussed ways to introduce CRC screening in France in the 75-80 age group. IRB: An institutional review board composed of members of the 2 learned societies (SOFOG and FFCD) defined the issues of interest, followed the evolution of the work and reviewed and validated the report.",We have done a systematic literature review about CRC Screening over 75Â years old in order to update knowledge and make recommendations.,"PUBMED database was searched in October 2021 for articles published on CRC screening in the elderly, and generated 249 articles.

The current literature does not allow Evidence-Based Medicine propositions for mass screening above 75 years old. As some subjects over 75 years may benefit from CRC screening."," The benefits and harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in individuals aged 75 and over are a subject of ongoing debate. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggests that screening for CRC in average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years can reduce the incidence and mortality of CRC [1][3][4][14]. However, the potential benefits of CRC prevention become less robust in those aged 75 and over due to increased comorbidities and decreased life expectancy [9]. Nonetheless, a retrospective study found that older patients who underwent CRC interventions had a low mortality rate, suggesting that they may tolerate such interventions more liberally than previously thought [17]. Guidelines generally recommend that screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 should be individualized based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history [3][4]. Furthermore, a comparative modeling study found that the additional life-years gained from continuing screening after age 75 were generally small [18]. 

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that colorectal cancer screening decisions for individuals aged 75 and over should be individualized, considering factors such as life expectancy, health status, and patient preferences. The benefits of screening in this age group may be less robust and the potential harms may be greater compared to younger individuals.

The decision to screen should be based on various factors such as comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and patient preferences [2][10][14]. While age is a significant risk factor for CRC, it is also associated with increased risks and adverse events during screening procedures [14][16]. Studies suggest that screening programs can lead to early detection and decrease in CRC incidence and mortality [4][5][9]. However, the benefits of screening for individuals aged 75 and over should be weighed against potential harms, particularly in those with decreased life expectancy [5][10][14][15]. The use of non-invasive screening methods and frailty indices may be beneficial for this age group [7][14]. The evidence is limited by the lack of large-scale studies specifically focusing on this age group and the potential biases in the available studies.

TL;DR: CRC screening should be considered for individuals up to the age of 75, with individualized decisions for those aged 76 to 85 based on comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and patient preferences. However, the benefits and potential harms should be carefully weighed, particularly in those with decreased life expectancy.

However, screening up to age 85 may be considered for persons without prior screening, depending on age and comorbidities [11].

Tahan 2014 agrees that screening is cost-effective up to age 86, with colonoscopy being most effective and cost-effective until age 83 years, sigmoidoscopy at age 84 years, and fecal immunochemical testing at age 86 years. However, Calonge 2008 recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years, and against screening in adults older than age 85 years, due to insufficient evidence of benefits and harms of screening modalities."," The benefits and harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in individuals aged 75 and over are a subject of ongoing debate. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggests that screening for CRC in average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years can reduce the incidence and mortality of CRC [1][3][4][14]. However, the potential benefits of CRC prevention become less robust in those aged 75 and over due to increased comorbidities and decreased life expectancy [9]. Nonetheless, a retrospective study found that older patients who underwent CRC interventions had a low mortality rate, suggesting that they may tolerate such interventions more liberally than previously thought [17]. Guidelines generally recommend that screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 should be individualized based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history [3][4]. Furthermore, a comparative modeling study found that the additional life-years gained from continuing screening after age 75 were generally small [18]. 

"," Current evidence suggests that colorectal cancer screening decisions for individuals aged 75 and over should be individualized, considering factors such as life expectancy, health status, and patient preferences. The benefits of screening in this age group may be less robust and the potential harms may be greater compared to younger individuals.

"," The current body of evidence suggests that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening should be considered for individuals up to the age of 75, with individualized decisions for those aged 76 to 85 [1][5]. The decision to screen should be based on various factors such as comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and patient preferences [2][10][14]. While age is a significant risk factor for CRC, it is also associated with increased risks and adverse events during screening procedures [14][16]. Studies suggest that screening programs can lead to early detection and decrease in CRC incidence and mortality [4][5][9]. However, the benefits of screening for individuals aged 75 and over should be weighed against potential harms, particularly in those with decreased life expectancy [5][10][14][15]. The use of non-invasive screening methods and frailty indices may be beneficial for this age group [7][14]. The evidence is limited by the lack of large-scale studies specifically focusing on this age group and the potential biases in the available studies.

"," CRC screening should be considered for individuals up to the age of 75, with individualized decisions for those aged 76 to 85 based on comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and patient preferences. However, the benefits and potential harms should be carefully weighed, particularly in those with decreased life expectancy.

"," The US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend routine colorectal cancer (CRC) screening from ages 45 to 75, with individualized consideration of screening ages 76 to 85 [1]. The American Cancer Society (ACS) also recommends that adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years [9]. For individuals aged 76 through 85 years, screening decisions should be individualized based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history [9]. The risk to benefit ratio of CRC screening starts to shift in individuals aged 75 and over, with the potential benefits of CRC prevention becoming less certain, while the risk of screening-related complications grows [8]. The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF) suggests discontinuation of screening should be considered at age 75 or with less than 10 years of life expectancy [11]. However, screening up to age 85 may be considered for persons without prior screening, depending on age and comorbidities [11]. 

"," Current evidence suggests that routine screening for colorectal cancer should be individualized for people aged 75 and over, taking into account their overall health status, life expectancy, and prior screening history.

","The US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society and many other expert councils recommend that adults aged 45 and over begin regular screening for colorectal cancer, which should continue until the age of 75. For those with high-risk attributes and a positive family history, screening can start even earlier. For patients aged 75 and older, it should be determined based on their individual preferences, health status, life expectancy and prior screening history. USPSTF does not recommend routine CRC screening in adults 86 years and older.",0.7957136034965515,0.21198156682027652,0.25576035433574484,38.702974504099544,0.08620689655172414,0.8413560853405614,0.0,0.5983834425950872,0.29577276561797977,0.7826979160308838,0.1515151515151515,0.2431320858003083,36.11923554962196,0.07471264367816093,0.7451487710219923,0.0,0.5952086165066688,0.2821864986699202,0.7963752746582031,0.17804154302670622,0.17375959996092746,30.20256586662533,0.07344064386317907,1.0,0.0,0.5739072810333988,0.30517236506955225,0.8010847568511963,0.16197183098591547,0.1926476553495889,35.36862242350242,0.07957559681697612,1.0,0.0,0.5859816406292938,0.3085893166869967,0.7974422574043274,0.18285714285714286,0.28171589310829814,37.80829726999973,0.06130268199233716,0.7991732362708697,0.0,0.6195447376516999,0.29559887489744247,0.7831676602363586,0.1786743515850144,0.1559996960129665,29.030743781858824,0.07747747747747748,1.0,0.0,0.5488945279074343,0.2945726652936319,0.7829557061195374,0.18243243243243243,0.17421693219256854,34.27174177472742,0.09122401847575058,1.0,0.0,0.5455556858727273,0.2943671299417384,0.8134407997131348,0.17341040462427745,0.2777604437510834,37.419477921069635,0.06896551724137931,0.7667615351444589,0.0,0.6579648400656879,0.30565856155117366,0.7964377999305725,0.1945288753799392,0.19525412490314345,32.29990080989478,0.09611451942740286,1.0,0.0,0.5833119969000525,0.3072587980652102,0.798999011516571,0.2162162162162162,0.2103871327429152,36.777105253043715,0.11070559610705596,1.0,0.0,0.5940544872841936,0.3101541441777388,0.7907108664512634,0.14193548387096774,0.2579288939051919,33.06700837637502,0.038314176245210725,0.8830278389139967,0.0,0.6362660129865011,0.28532432500229965,0.7961353659629822,0.15498154981549814,0.19226323350886473,35.35497777017657,0.08888888888888889,0.9611245476873466,0.0,0.5888334417626971,0.2986683197563652,0.8055303692817688,0.169811320754717,0.2617398097769999,39.14247702002081,0.1111111111111111,0.835412534138278,0.0,0.6217916382933563,0.3045750537336151
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,When Is a Diverting Stoma Indicated after Low Anterior Resection? A Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials and Meta-Regression of the Risk Factors of Leakage and Complications in Non-Diverted Patients.,"BACKGROUND:
Anastomotic leak (AL) is a potentially life-threatening complication after low anterior resection (LAR). This meta-analysis aimed to compare outcomes of LAR with and without diverting stoma and to determine factors associated with AL in non-diverted patients.

METHODS:
This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). Randomized controlled trials comparing LAR with and without diverting stoma were included. Main outcome measures were AL, complications, and operation time in the two groups and risk factors of AL in non-diverted patients.

RESULTS:
Nine randomized control trials (RCTs) (946 patients; 53.2% male) were included. The diverting stoma group had lower odds of complications (OR: 0.61, 95%CI: 0.461-0.828; pâ<â0.001), AL (OR: 0.362, 95%CI: 0.236-0.555; pâ<â0.001, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0), abscess (OR: 0.392, 95%CI: 0.174-0.883; pâ<â0.024, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0), and reoperation (OR: 0.352, 95%CI: 0.222-0.559, pâ<â0.001, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0) than the no-diversion group. Both groups had comparable odds of bowel obstruction, surgical site infection, and perioperative mortality. The weighted mean operation time in the diverting stoma group was longer than the no-diversion group (WMD: 34.804, 95%CI: 14.649-54.960, pâ<â0.001). Factors significantly associated with AL in non-diverted patients were higher body mass index (BMI), ASAââ¥â3, lower tumor height, neoadjuvant therapy, open surgery, end-to-end anastomosis, and longer operation time.

CONCLUSIONS:
Non-diverted patients with increased body mass index, high American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, low rectal cancers, received neoadjuvant therapy, underwent open surgery, end-to-end anastomosis, and longer operation times were at a higher risk of AL after LAR.",Anastomotic leak (AL) is a potentially life-threatening complication after low anterior resection (LAR).

The incidence of rectovaginal fistula (RVF), a complication that can be managed by a diverting stoma, was found to be 1.61% in a large retrospective study, primarily associated with short tumor to anal verge distance and unsatisfactory anastomosis [1].

A different approach to managing diverticulitis, such as diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, was proposed as an alternative to more invasive surgery [3].

The use of transanal drainage tubes (TDTs) did not significantly affect anastomotic leakage (AL) rates, and the presence of diverting stomas did not affect the AL rate [5].

TL;DR: A diverting stoma after low anterior resection may be indicated in cases of short tumor to anal verge distance, unsatisfactory anastomosis, or risk of rectal cancer recurrence, but it is associated with higher morbidity rates and stoma-related complications.

1. High risk of anastomotic leakage: This is the most common reason for a diverting stoma. Factors that increase the risk of anastomotic leakage include male gender, obesity, preoperative radiation, and intraoperative technical difficulties.

2. Poor general condition of the patient: If the patient's overall health is poor, a diverting stoma may be created to reduce the risk of complications.

3. High preoperative radiation dose: Radiation can damage tissues and impair healing, increasing the risk of anastomotic leakage.

4. Intraoperative complications: If complications occur during surgery, such as significant blood loss or damage to surrounding tissues, a diverting stoma may be created to allow the anastomosis to heal.

5. Previous anastomotic leakage: If the patient has had an anastomotic leakage in the past, a diverting stoma may be created to prevent a recurrence.

6. Emergency surgery: In emergency situations, a diverting stoma may be created to allow time for the anastomosis to heal.

7. T4 tumors or tumors with a threatened margin: In these cases, a diverting stoma may be created to reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage.

It's important to note that the decision to create a diverting stoma is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's overall health, the specifics of their disease, and the risks and benefits of the procedure.","A diverting stoma is indicated after a low anterior resection in certain situations. These include cases where there is a high risk of anastomotic leak, such as in patients with poor bowel preparation, significant comorbidities, or a history of radiation therapy. Additionally, a diverting stoma may be considered in cases where there is difficulty in achieving a tension-free anastomosis, inadequate blood supply to the anastomosis, or technical difficulties during the surgery.

Ulrich 2009 conducted a randomized controlled trial and found that the symptomatic anastomotic leakage rate was significantly higher in patients who did not receive a diverting stoma. Leester 2002 found that while a diverting stoma cannot prevent anastomotic leaks, it can mitigate their clinical consequences, and is beneficial for high-risk patients who are unfit for a second abdominal procedure. However, Messaris 2015 found that a diverting stoma did not decrease mortality or infectious complications in mid-high rectal cancer patients undergoing low anterior resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and that the decision to construct a protective stoma should not be driven solely on the receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation."," The decision to create a diverting stoma after low anterior resection (LAR) should be carefully considered given the potential risks and benefits.

","When a low anterior resection is performed, a diverting stoma is usually indicated when a primary repair or resection and anastomosis of the bowel injury are not possible. In high-risk situations, a surgeon can opt for repair and anastomosis, diversion, or a damage control approach with an anastomosis after resuscitation and stabilization. Diversion may also be necessary in cases of delays greater than 12 hours, transfusion of more than six units of blood, contamination, and left-sided injuries.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Is a Distal Resection Margin ofââ¤â1Â cm Safe in Patients with Intermediate- to Low-Lying Rectal Cancer? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It is generally accepted that the distal resection margin of intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer should be greater than 2Â cm and at least 1Â cm in special cases. This study intends to investigate whether a distal resection marginââ¤â1Â cm affects tumor outcomes for patients with intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Sixteen studies included data for distal resection marginsââ¤â1Â cm (1684 cases) andâ>â1Â cm (5877 cases), and 5 studies included survival data. Meta-analysis was used to compare the local recurrence rate and long-term survival of patients with distal resection marginsâ>âorââ¤â1Â cm.

RESULTS:
The local recurrence rate in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (9.5%) was 2.3% higher than that in theâ>â1-cm margin group (7.2%) according to a fixed-effects model (RR [95% CI] 1.42 [1.18, 1.70], Pâ<â0.001). The overall survival results of the five 1-cm margin studies showed an HR (95% CI) of 0.96 (0.75, 1.24) (Pâ=â0.78). Subgroup analysis showed that the local recurrence rate in the subgroup with perioperative treatment was 1.2% lower in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (8.3%) than in theâ>â1-cm margin group (9.5%) (RR [95% CI] 0.97 [0.63, 1.49], Pâ=â0.90). In the surgery alone subgroup, the local recurrence rate was 4.7% higher in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (12.4%) than in theâ>â1-cm group (7.7%) (RR [95% CI] 1.76 [1.09, 2.83], Pâ=â0.02).

Some studies suggest that a distal resection margin of â¤ 1 cm is safe and does not increase the risk of local recurrence or compromise oncological outcomes in patients with intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer. These studies argue that a shorter distal margin may be acceptable in certain cases, especially when combined with other factors such as a clear circumferential resection margin and neoadjuvant therapy.

However, other studies have shown that a distal resection margin of â¤ 1 cm may be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and poorer oncological outcomes. These studies emphasize the importance of achieving a clear distal margin of at least 2 cm to minimize the risk of tumor involvement at the surgical margin.

It is important to note that the optimal distal resection margin for rectal cancer surgery is still a matter of ongoing research and debate. The decision regarding the appropriate distal margin should be individualized based on various factors, including tumor characteristics, patient factors, and surgeon experience.

","The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) all recommend a minimum of 12 nodes for surgical resection of rectal cancer to improve prognosis and reduce local-distant recurrence. To avoid this recurrence, a mesorectal resection (R0) with negative circumferential resection margins (CRM) is necessary. Lymph node involvement is the strongest predictor of outcome. Local excision is an acceptable choice for patients with cT1N0 rectal cancer with favorable clinical and histological characteristics, but cure rates and local recurrence are lower than expected. Distal resection margin ≤ 1 cm can be safe in patients with intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer, but should be reserved for unique circumstances.",0.7683529853820801,0.24137931034482762,0.13207588305211754,24.6854136093831,0.08768267223382047,1.0,0.0,0.5817118199180356,0.2898511879434252,0.7805985808372498,0.2153846153846154,0.28494683557076605,42.173026718958404,0.1088560885608856,0.726015489173384,0.0,0.6386295802552592,0.2927602468695627,0.7524133920669556,0.17358490566037735,0.20234587221748254,30.216282335529883,0.1059190031152648,1.0,0.0,0.5700987195596099,0.28047941641713164,0.7545773983001709,0.17857142857142858,0.26488764318316743,35.522820093854534,0.11808118081180811,0.8440086703244598,0.0,0.5709841578526604,0.27463664035818436,0.76656174659729,0.14634146341463417,0.3575150300601202,40.605364032293,0.07195571955719557,0.7788916736285157,0.0,0.6540957187060956,0.27921984664737065,0.7807658910751343,0.21316614420062696,0.18610445726433186,27.894355542545085,0.09507829977628636,1.0,0.0,0.5832139232404716,0.29810711143926916,0.7792688012123108,0.21754385964912282,0.17402259160500916,30.95211234392355,0.10455764075067024,1.0,0.0,0.583962652264005,0.2990529046569892,0.7736898064613342,0.14012738853503184,0.41276913875598087,40.28981919980066,0.07749077490774908,0.836793560477771,0.0,0.703478854894638,0.28840560936207316,0.8035174012184143,0.2330623306233062,0.21515883504285074,27.436976608381325,0.12431444241316271,1.0,0.0,0.5963096009846492,0.3152645171491767,0.801595151424408,0.2445141065830721,0.19266179688561408,29.710040622355883,0.12128146453089245,1.0,0.0,0.5980224732224267,0.31335707812314306,0.7837405800819397,0.18497109826589594,0.44963918159826155,43.51331704172934,0.1014760147601476,0.7471776287565761,0.0,0.6712698305646578,0.2983399467361718,0.7773411273956299,0.22522522522522523,0.22096535546429377,37.89278454289941,0.12730627306273062,0.7833604280972702,0.0,0.6063514120819032,0.2879446135373807,0.7624481916427612,0.14876033057851237,0.18899628252788103,30.640734844025946,0.1014760147601476,1.0,0.0,0.5725986830062336,0.27808463381830145
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Is inguinal hernia associated with an increased risk of colon cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The presence of an inguinal hernia has been associated with an increased risk of identifying colon cancer, and therefore colonoscopy is recommended prior to inguinal hernia repair. However, the evidence on the association between the presence of an inguinal hernia and colon cancer is conflicting and uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize all available evidence on this topic.

METHODS:
A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed. Any comparative study (case-control or cohort study) comparing the rate of colon cancer detection in patients with and without inguinal hernias who underwent screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted and pooled under a random effects model.

RESULTS:
The initial search identified 692 references, of which 4 comparative studies (1462 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low. Pooled results showed a statistically non-significant difference in the incidence of detection of colon cancer, with patients with inguinal hernia having a 1.26 times increased likelihood of colon cancer diagnosis compared with patients without inguinal hernia (odds ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-2.51; Pâ=â0.51). Although patients with inguinal hernia were also 1.23 times more likely to be diagnosed with colon polyps compared to patients without inguinal hernia, this difference was statistically non-significant (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.94-1.60; Pâ=â0.12).

CONCLUSION:
The findings from this first systematic review and meta-analysis show that there is no difference in the incidence of either colon cancer or colon polyps in patients presenting with inguinal hernias compared to those without. Nevertheless, larger prospective studies are needed to further investigate the relationship between the risk of colon cancer or polyps and the presence of inguinal hernia.","The presence of an inguinal hernia has been associated with an increased risk of identifying colon cancer, and therefore colonoscopy is recommended prior to inguinal hernia repair.

There is no difference in the incidence of either colon cancer or colon polyps in patients presenting with inguinal hernias compared to those without. Nevertheless, larger prospective studies are needed to further investigate the relationship between the risk of colon cancer or polyps and the presence of inguinal hernia."," The majority of the articles reviewed suggest that there is no direct association between inguinal hernia and an increased risk of colon cancer. A case-control study with a sample size of 243 patients with inguinal hernia and 534 control patients found no increased risk of colon cancer in asymptomatic patients with inguinal hernia [1]. This finding is supported by a prospective clinical trial involving 100 patients with inguinal hernia and 100 controls, which also found no cases of colon cancer in the hernia group [5]. Conversely, several case reports present rare occurrences of colon cancer presenting within an inguinal hernia [2,4,9,10,11]. However, these are individual cases and do not provide sufficient evidence to establish a direct association due to their limited generalizability and potential for bias. Other articles either do not provide direct evidence on the association [3,6,7,8] or suggest that further research is needed [6,8].

TL;DR: Current evidence, primarily from a case-control study and a prospective clinical trial, suggests that inguinal hernia is not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, although rare cases of colon cancer presenting within an inguinal hernia have been reported.

Inguinal hernia occurs when a part of the intestine or abdominal tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the inguinal canal in the groin area. It is a common condition and is typically caused by a combination of factors such as aging, genetics, and increased pressure in the abdomen. On the other hand, colon cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the colon or rectum. It is primarily associated with risk factors such as age, family history, certain genetic conditions, and lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity. While both conditions can occur simultaneously in some individuals, there is no direct causal relationship between inguinal hernia and an increased risk of colon cancer.","The papers have mixed findings on the association between inguinal hernia and colon cancer. Avidan 2002 found no evidence of an increased risk for colorectal cancer in patients with an inguinal hernia. Birolini 2005 presented three cases of elderly patients with inguinal hernia and colon cancer, but concluded that the association between the two is mainly coincidental. Avidan 2004 found that the presence of an inguinal hernia alone does not justify screening colonoscopy before herniorrhaphy.

","Inguinal hernia has both a congenital and acquired component. Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, chronic cough, heavy lifting, and constipation can contribute to inguinal hernias. There is an increased risk for individuals with family history of hernia, as well as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal disease,<i>Helicobacter</i><i>pylori</i> Infection-A Risk Factor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome? An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"UNLABELLED:
Nowadays, the relationship between <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection (HPI) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains controversial.

OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the association between HPI and IBS. Subgroup analyses were conducted for further assessment and exploration of heterogeneity sources. In addition, we assessed publication bias through funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results.

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies with 13,173 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between HPI and IBS was 1.03 (95% CI [0.80,1.31]; <i>p</i> = 0.84). The adjusted OR of the association between HPI and IBS after excluding the studies with confounding factors defined by our team was 1.29 (95% CI [1.03,1.62]; <i>p</i> = 0.03). We found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D (diarrhea subtype) (OR: 1.54; 95% CI [1.22,1.95]; <i>p</i> = 0.0003). The OR of the relationship between cytotoxin-associated gene A (Cag A) positive HPI and IBS was 4.3 (95% CI [0.51,36.17]; <i>p</i> = 0.18).

CONCLUSIONS:
The likelihood of HPI in IBS patients is relatively higher than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant, implying that HPI is not significantly associated with IBS, albeit we may underestimate this association. Moreover, we found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D. We also observed an increased likelihood of Cag-A positive HPI in IBS patients than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant.",The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.,"We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021.

","Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common, chronic bacterial infection which is found with varying prevalence in different countries, populations, and age groups. It is believed to be associated with the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma as well as other GI symptoms. Evaluations over recent years have suggested that the decreasing prevalence of H. pylori infection in Western populations may contribute to the development of Barrett's esophagus and related dysplastic changes. It has been recommended to test suspected patients for H. pylori and eradicate the bacteria prior to NSAID use in order to reduce the risk of upper GI ulcers. Although there is no clear evidence that H. pylori infection is a risk factor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), further research is necessary to determine the potential impact of H. pylori on risk and progression of IBS.",0.7454003095626831,0.15384615384615385,0.10338684752747254,15.904356134768042,0.046632124352331605,1.0,0.0,0.45156639169401197,0.2501100280911897,0.7465423345565796,0.10989010989010989,0.09375,18.891319785609383,0.046511627906976744,1.0,0.0,0.4546565162234528,0.24519538894482362,0.7571249008178711,0.09615384615384616,0.06431107932840702,12.029575976513652,0.02784503631961259,1.0,0.0,0.4702127245183174,0.26977955620967065,0.7641518712043762,0.09625668449197859,0.07278648697632399,13.564424532543168,0.031506849315068496,1.0,0.0,0.48632645334250163,0.2753791574234636,0.7391464114189148,0.07407407407407407,0.06912442396313365,19.88069800271789,0.02112676056338028,0.759656652360515,0.0,0.469209234080007,0.23702155429874047,0.7523928284645081,0.1111111111111111,0.05267778753292362,11.831109872383266,0.027184466019417475,1.0,0.0,0.459194693248719,0.2707219113412217,0.7557485103607178,0.1220657276995305,0.058448459086078625,14.031348184820377,0.03044496487119438,1.0,0.0,0.47085183774842354,0.27460396182439134,0.7739822864532471,0.1388888888888889,0.11335012594458439,27.85044402903526,0.05844155844155844,0.857653791130186,0.0,0.514188888729835,0.2615979598600137,0.7554009556770325,0.1220657276995305,0.08363252073148505,13.124728428966142,0.0340632603406326,1.0,0.0,0.4670686670045816,0.2707817057065928,0.7606625556945801,0.13636363636363635,0.0860528097494922,15.736883350415292,0.034954407294832825,1.0,0.0,0.4772162119979444,0.2722775404288754,0.7765219807624817,0.14285714285714285,0.17175675675675675,24.96843722924812,0.07746478873239436,0.8862660944206009,0.0,0.5204754453897477,0.27529310959740005,0.7716010808944702,0.16149068322981366,0.12000950570342205,15.153328544798644,0.04745762711864407,1.0,0.0,0.4923978228826781,0.27575074871559496,0.7430943250656128,0.1005586592178771,0.06753061859460886,11.815509916828844,0.02631578947368421,1.0,0.0,0.4528460573513531,0.2556054074547608
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,A systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic-assisted transabdominal total mesorectal excision and transanal total mesorectal excision: which approach offers optimal short-term outcomes for mid-to-low rectal adenocarcinoma?,"BACKGROUND:
Resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma can be challenging in the narrow pelvis of male patients. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) appears to offer technical advantages for distal rectal tumours, and robotic-assisted transabdominal TME (rTME) was introduced in effort to improve operative precision and ergonomics. However, no study has comprehensively compared these approaches. The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to compare postoperative short-term outcomes in rTME and TaTME.

METHODS:
A systematic online search (1974-July 2020) of MEDLINE, Embase, web of science and google scholar was conducted for trials, prospective or retrospective studies involving rTME, or TaTME for rectal cancer. Outcome variables included: hospital stay; operation duration, blood loss; resection margins; proportion of histologically complete resected specimens; lymph nodes; overall complications; anastomotic leak, and 30-day mortality.

RESULTS:
Sixty-two articles met the inclusion criteria, including 37 studies (3835 patients) assessing rTME resection, 23 studies (1326 patients) involving TaTME and 2 comparing both (165 patients). Operating time was longer in rTME (309.2Â min, 95% CI 285.5-332.8) than in TaTME studies (256.2Â min, 95% CI 231.5-280.9) (pâ=â0.002). rTME resected specimens had a larger distal resection margin (2.62Â cm, 95% CI 2.35-2.88) than in TaTME studies (2.10Â cm, 95% CI 1.83-2.36) (pâ=â0.007). Other outcome variables did not significantly differ between the two techniques.

CONCLUSIONS:
rTME provides similar pathological and short-term outcomes to TaTME and both are reasonable surgical approaches for patients with mid-to-low rectal cancer. To definitively answer the question of the optimal TME technique, we suggest a prospective trial comparing both techniques assessing long-term survival as a primary outcome.","Resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma can be challenging in the narrow pelvis of male patients.

A larger retrospective cohort study comparing TaTME and robotic TME (R-TME) found similar rates of poor-quality resection and no significant differences in TME specimen quality or circumferential resection margin. However, it suggested a higher risk of distal resection margin involvement with TaTME [5]. Given the limited evidence and potential for bias, it is difficult to definitively conclude which approach offers optimal short-term outcomes.

","Robotic-assisted transabdominal total mesorectal excision (TME) is the optimal approach for managing mid-to-low rectal adenocarcinoma, offering improved short-term outcomes. TME is an en bloc resection of the rectum including a complete pararectal lymphadenectomy with an intact rectal fascia. It has significantly reduced local recurrence and improved 5-year survival rates compared to traditional rectal resection and transanal total mesorectal excision (Ta-TME), respectively. Transanal endoscopic total mesorectal excision (Ta-TME) is also a viable option offered for the treatment of rectal cancer, however, it is limited by exposure and visibility which may not be sufficient for achieving high-quality oncological resections.",0.7994869351387024,0.14018691588785048,0.17948903777190836,30.814546787882303,0.07169811320754717,1.0,0.0,0.5854239085742405,0.30372989248580984,0.8020971417427063,0.19428571428571428,0.20717669759336685,36.8341511950024,0.08629441624365482,0.8207001693958216,0.0,0.5661999368241855,0.2991222893970257,0.7882566452026367,0.13284132841328414,0.15517291739689215,25.36467078079071,0.059850374064837904,1.0,0.0,0.5330060028039946,0.2917707622823391,0.8059386014938354,0.16363636363636364,0.19762602829409925,31.9223253492807,0.07457627118644068,1.0,0.0,0.5573119105088828,0.3008499544985306,0.7867385149002075,0.16541353383458646,0.26162927981109796,37.558144641500924,0.05621301775147929,0.8107655502392345,0.0,0.5743186258171734,0.2815049323295954,0.724990725517273,0.09714285714285716,0.08451803808525507,16.396355533255047,0.029197080291970802,1.0,0.0,0.44737490865329627,0.25278058321163555,0.7274588942527771,0.10921501706484642,0.09418826696719258,19.978189268545517,0.034513274336283185,1.0,0.0,0.44285280569496316,0.2521410332240528,0.7889919877052307,0.1726618705035971,0.21615646258503401,34.69666598305526,0.05621301775147929,0.7381818181818182,0.0,0.580908047716792,0.2831246767545831,0.7942320108413696,0.17777777777777778,0.14537244049014508,21.622194599985285,0.0665024630541872,1.0,0.0,0.5469905958253873,0.3039753347880681,0.8127694129943848,0.2147651006711409,0.1717615129227286,27.221739118942743,0.08422174840085288,1.0,0.0,0.5700561785733843,0.31371670571640903,0.820014476776123,0.25,0.31444608325139295,39.92234681390296,0.08875739644970414,0.8077402597402598,0.0,0.6120791835444314,0.31167731937182086,0.813090443611145,0.165938864628821,0.19033365686673556,31.891407448559832,0.10677966101694915,1.0,0.0,0.5731386714719336,0.31084056047672326,0.792322039604187,0.11640211640211642,0.16907307427339366,33.12429604464269,0.07174887892376682,1.0,0.0,0.5708575390956618,0.29573636917022583
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Should the rectal defect be closed following transanal local excision of rectal tumors? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Transanal local excision (TLE) has become the treatment of choice for benign and early-stage selected malignant tumors. However, closure of the rectal wall defect remains a controversial point and the available literature still remains unclear. Our aim was to determine through a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of relevant studies whether or not the wall defect following TLE of rectal tumors should be closed.

METHODS:
Medline and the Cochrane Trials Register were searched for trials published up to December 2016 comparing open versus closed management of the surgical rectal defect after TLE of rectal tumors. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0.

RESULTS:
Four studies were analyzed, yielding 489 patients (317 in the closed group and 182 in the open group). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the closed and open groups regarding the overall morbidity rate (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.32-4.91; pÂ =Â 0.74), postoperative local infection rate (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.23-1.62; pÂ =Â 0.33), postoperative bleeding rate (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.29-1.77; pÂ =Â 0.63), and postoperative reintervention rate (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.52-9.47; pÂ =Â 0.29).

CONCLUSIONS:
This review and meta-analysis suggest that there is no difference between closure or non-closure of wall defects after TLE.","Transanal local excision (TLE) has become the treatment of choice for benign and early-stage selected malignant tumors.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,How Efficacious Are Patient Education Interventions to Improve Bowel Preparation for Colonoscopy? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Bowel preparation is inadequate in a large proportion of colonoscopies, leading to multiple clinical and economic harms. While most patients receive some form of education before colonoscopy, there is no consensus on the best approach.

AIMS:
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of patient education interventions to improve bowel preparation.

METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Database, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a patient education intervention; (2) a primary aim of improving bowel preparation; (3) a validated bowel preparation scale; (4) a prospective design; (5) a concurrent control group; and, (6) adult participants. Study validity was assessed using a modified Downs and Black scale.

RESULTS:
1,080 abstracts were screened. Seven full text studies met inclusion criteria, including 2,660 patients. These studies evaluated multiple delivery platforms, including paper-based interventions (three studies), videos (two studies), re-education telephone calls the day before colonoscopy (one study), and in-person education by physicians (one study). Bowel preparation significantly improved with the intervention in all but one study. All but one study were done in a single center. Validity scores ranged from 13 to 24 (maximum 27). Four of five abstracts and research letters that met inclusion criteria also showed improvements in bowel preparation. Statistical and clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.

CONCLUSION:
Compared to usual care, patient education interventions appear efficacious in improving the quality of bowel preparation. However, because of the small scale of the studies and individualized nature of the interventions, results of these studies may not be generalizable to other settings. Healthcare practices should consider systematically evaluating their current bowel preparation education methods before undertaking new interventions.","Bowel preparation is inadequate in a large proportion of colonoscopies, leading to multiple clinical and economic harms.

A single-session, telephone-based motivational interview has been found effective in increasing colorectal screening for primary care populations [2]. Furthermore, a diabetes-specific bowel preparation protocol has shown a threefold reduction in the rate of inadequate bowel preparation compared to a conventional protocol in patients with type 2 diabetes [3]. In terms of diet, no significant difference in bowel cleansing quality was found between a clear liquid diet and a regular diet when used with a polyethylene glycol solution [4]. A remote tailored intervention (Tele-Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation) was more effective than a mailed educational brochure in improving colonoscopy uptake among at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer patients [5].

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Does lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy pose a risk for mother and child? - a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Gastrointestinal endoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal disorders. When endoscopy is indicated during pregnancy, concerns about the effects on pregnancy outcome often arise. The aim of this study was to assess whether lower gastrointestinal endoscopies (LGEs) across all three trimesters of pregnancy affects pregnancy outcomes.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was performed using Embase (including MEDLINE), Medline OvidSP, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web-of-Science, Google scholar and Pubmed. All original research articles from 1990 until May 2014 involving pregnant women who underwent LGE for any indication were included. Adverse pregnancy events like spontaneous abortion, preterm birth and fetal demise were assessed for a temporal and etiological relation with the LGE.

RESULTS:
In total, 5514 references were screened by two independent reviewers. Eighty-two references met the inclusion criteria and were selected. Two retrospective, controlled studies, one uncontrolled study and 79 case reports were identified. In the three studies, birth outcomes did not differ between women undergoing LGE during pregnancy, compared to women that had an indication for LGE but in whom LGE was not performed because of pregnancy. In 79 case reports, 92 patients are described who underwent 100 LGE's during pregnancy. LGEs performed in all trimesters (n = 32, 39 and 29) were both temporally and etiologically related to 1, 3 and 2 adverse events, respectively.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the available literature, this review concludes that lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy is of low risk for mother and child in all three trimesters of pregnancy.","Gastrointestinal endoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal disorders.

A prospective study involving 42 pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) found that lower GI endoscopy did not significantly increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, but was associated with lower median birth weight. However, no significant differences were observed in gestational age at birth, congenital abnormalities, or APGAR scores [2]. A retrospective study involving 54 pregnant women who underwent sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy reported no complications during the procedures and most delivered healthy babies. Three fetal demises were reported, but were not related to the procedures [3]. On the other hand, a narrative review suggests that gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy may pose risks to the fetus, including hypoxia, premature labor, trauma, and teratogenesis. However, it also suggests that certain procedures, including sigmoidoscopy, are considered safe for both the fetus and pregnant patient, while others should only be performed when necessary, with precautions taken to minimize potential risks [4]. The evidence from these studies is somewhat limited by small sample sizes and potential biases, and the lack of specific details in some cases makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

TL;DR: While some risks have been associated with lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy, such as lower median birth weight, the evidence suggests that these procedures can be performed safely in pregnant women with necessary precautions.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Are gastrointestinal symptoms associated with higher risk of Mortality in COVID-19 patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Several clinical investigations suggested that gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with disease severity of COVID-19. However, the relevance of gastrointestinal symptoms and mortality of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aim to investigate the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19 mortality.

METHODS:
We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane for studies published between Dec 1, 2019 and May 1, 2021, that had data on gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Additional literatures were obtained by screening the citations of included studies and recent reviews. Only studies that reported the mortality of COVID-19 patients with/without gastrointestinal symptoms were included. Raw data were pooled to calculate OR (Odds Ratio). The mortality was compared between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as between patients with and without individual symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain).

RESULTS:
Fifty-three literatures with 55,245 COVID-19 patients (4955 non-survivors and 50,290 survivors) were included. The presence of GI symptoms was not associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients (OR=0.88; 95% CI 0.71-1.09; P=0.23). As for individual symptoms, diarrhea (OR=1.01; 95% CI 0.72-1.41; P=0.96), nausea/vomiting (OR=1.16; 95% CI 0.78-1.71; P=0.46) and abdominal pain (OR=1.55; 95% CI 0.68-3.54; P=0.3) also showed non-relevance with the death of COVID-19 patients.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are not associated with higher mortality of COVID-19 patients.

","Yes, gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients and may be an important factor in determining the prognosis and mortality rate. A large cohort study from China indicated that 19% of 44415 COVID-19 patients developed severe or critical illness and a certain proportion of these patients were those that initially presented with primary GI-related symptoms or concurrent symptoms. Additionally, a meta-analysis by Elmunzer et al. revealed that 53% of studied patients reported GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. A case report established the incidence of hemorrhagic colitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, patients may be at risk of acute mesenteric ischemia and portal vein thrombosis due to a hypercoagulable state associated with the virus and these conditions can be fatal. Thus, it is important for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion and evaluate for GI symptoms while assessing patients with possible COVID-19 infection and refer them for appropriate triaging and testing. Proper prevention measures, such as social distancing, contact tracing and testing, as well as contact precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, are also crucial.",0.8491197824478149,0.28800000000000003,0.25142237922738714,48.05050973277511,0.14233576642335766,0.6687125220458554,0.0,0.6811625815573192,0.34890105923533715,0.8528563380241394,0.2692307692307693,0.20765090633327368,44.59445715180107,0.128099173553719,0.7813271604938271,0.0,0.6666692778468132,0.34107572800590275,0.8221902847290039,0.21568627450980393,0.1657405147164872,29.530001125584814,0.0746031746031746,1.0,0.0,0.5722728905516055,0.32055178671882006,0.8142774701118469,0.20994475138121546,0.15394556278324745,31.315124709094622,0.06792452830188679,1.0,0.0,0.5591739971529354,0.3121165892993718,0.8504685163497925,0.2716049382716049,0.38833347104023797,46.498344840976145,0.08264462809917356,0.7557800224466891,0.0,0.7235159113489348,0.3477599708707368,0.8180359601974487,0.18604651162790697,0.1251259147557104,20.541464267890913,0.05566218809980806,1.0,0.0,0.5748870610994729,0.32135256171486243,0.8186707496643066,0.216,0.1376781658364566,24.425675495500126,0.0687960687960688,1.0,0.0,0.5836525556941827,0.3222595029602447,0.8413779735565186,0.2018348623853211,0.23238974279755928,40.75599145020236,0.08677685950413223,0.7556723748838444,0.0,0.6206488033472481,0.3239313007941187,0.8229327201843262,0.16993464052287582,0.10198581143899449,19.703166257156575,0.051351351351351354,1.0,0.0,0.5596127106073481,0.3203971453779568,0.8229492902755737,0.16091954022988506,0.1083056872037915,22.535643911980312,0.056291390728476824,1.0,0.0,0.5665422452783043,0.3217390526182004,0.8300763964653015,0.1941747572815534,0.2061017631951888,38.174352749531714,0.07851239669421488,0.7620223398001175,0.0,0.6148070451223625,0.3172789396310356,0.865968644618988,0.3184713375796178,0.23105862908837857,39.12975224286107,0.12944162436548223,1.0,0.0,0.6990260890487469,0.35699645263274987,0.8215032815933228,0.19685039370078736,0.12989285451158286,23.707879548092702,0.06506024096385542,1.0,0.0,0.551346654636193,0.3157606161761259
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Is there an association between <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and irritable bowel syndrome? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and debilitating gastrointestinal condition. Research has reported persistent, low-grade mucosal inflammation and significant overlaps between patients with IBS and those with dyspepsia, suggesting a possible pathogenic role of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) in IBS. This study therefore aimed to provide the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and IBS.

AIM:
To investigate the association between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and IBS.

METHODS:
Using the keywords ""<i>H. pylori</i> OR Helicobacter OR Helicobacter pylori OR infection"" AND ""irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS"", a preliminary search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar and WanFang databases yielded 2924 papers published in English between 1 January 1960 and 1 June 2018. Attempts were also made to search grey literature.

RESULTS:
A total of 13 clinical studies were systematically reviewed and nine studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis found a slight increased likelihood of <i>H. pylori</i> infection in patients with IBS, albeit this was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.90-2.40, <i>P</i> = 0.123). It must also be acknowledged that all of the available studies reported only crude odd ratios. <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy also does not appear to improve IBS symptoms. Although publication bias was not observed in the funnel plot, there was a high degree of heterogeneity amongst the studies included in the meta-analysis (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 87.38%).

CONCLUSION:
Overall, current evidence does not support an association between IBS and <i>H. pylori</i> infection. Further rigorous and detailed studies with larger sample sizes and after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy are warranted.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and debilitating gastrointestinal condition.

H. pylori is a ubiquitous, microaerophilic, gram-negative, bacillus that affects more than 50% of the population worldwide.

Treatment of infection before the initiation of NSAID use can reduce the risk of upper GI ulcers. A phase 3 clinical trial in children has documented the efficacy and safety of an oral recombinant H. Pylori vaccine to reduce the incidence of H. pylori infection.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Postoperative changes of the microbiome: are surgical complications related to the gut flora? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
The purpose of this review was to identify the relationship between the gut microbiome and the development of postoperative complications like anastomotic leakage or a wound infection. Recent reviews focusing on underlying molecular biology suggested that postoperative complications might be influenced by the patients' gut flora. Therefore, a review focusing on the available clinical data is needed.

METHODS:
In January 2017 a systematic search was carried out in Medline and WebOfScience to identify all clinical studies, which investigated postoperative complications after gastrointestinal surgery in relation to the microbiome of the gut.

RESULTS:
Of 337 results 10 studies were included into this analysis after checking for eligibility. In total, the studies comprised 677 patients. All studies reported a postoperative change of the gut flora. In five studies the amount of bacteria decreased to different degrees after surgery, but only one study found a significant reduction. Surgical procedures tended to result in an increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. The rate of infectious complications was lower in patients treated with probiotics/symbiotics compared to control groups without a clear relation to the systemic inflammatory response. The treatment with synbiotics/probiotics in addition resulted in faster recovery of bowel movement and a lower rate of postoperative diarrhea and abdominal cramping.

CONCLUSIONS:
There might be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications. Due to methodological shortcomings of the included studies and uncontrolled bias/confounding factors there remains a high level of uncertainty.","The purpose of this review was to identify the relationship between the gut microbiome and the development of postoperative complications like anastomotic leakage or a wound infection.

There might be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications. Due to methodological shortcomings of the included studies and uncontrolled bias/confounding factors there remains a high level of uncertainty."," Multiple articles provide evidence suggesting a relationship between gut flora and surgical complications. The gut microbiota is implicated in postoperative complications such as sepsis, anastomotic leak, and infections [1,3,8,14]. Studies also highlight the potential role of gut flora in specific surgical diseases of infancy and childhood [2], and in conditions such as Hirschsprung's-associated enterocolitis and Crohn's disease [11,16]. A randomized controlled trial found that oral administration of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BBG-01) in pediatric surgical cases significantly decreased postoperative infectious complications and improved the intestinal environment [4]. Another randomized controlled trial on colorectal surgery patients showed significant changes in fecal bacteria proportions with probiotic intervention, although it did not significantly affect the incidence of postoperative infectious complications [6]. A study on liver transplant patients found that disruption of the gut microbial balance may not effectively reduce the risk of postoperative infection [8]. There is also evidence suggesting that probiotics can improve gut barrier function and modulate the immune system, although more large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings [5]. 

TL;DR: There is evidence suggesting that the gut flora may be related to surgical complications, but further large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Changes in gut flora in critically ill patients are associated with nosocomial infections and may impact mortality [1]. Gut flora plays a role in surgical diseases of infancy and childhood, contributing to conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease [2]. The concept of ""gut origin sepsis"" has been proposed, linking surgical complications and gut flora [3]. A case study highlighted a patient with Crohn's disease who experienced sepsis due to gut flora pathogens [4]. The importance of maintaining gut flora through enteral nutrition to prevent bacterial translocation was discussed in cancer patients [5]. An animal study suggested gut microbiota modulation could alleviate sleep-restriction induced immunosuppression post-surgery [6]. Another study found that severe postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, were more common in patients with stent colonization by E. coli and Enterococcus [7]. An animal study on rats undergoing cardiac surgery found that surgery induced dysbiosis in the gut microbiome, which was accompanied by damage to the gut barrier and increased blood-brain barrier permeability [8].

The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the body's immune response and inflammation. Disruptions in the balance of the gut flora, known as dysbiosis, can potentially increase the risk of postoperative complications such as surgical site infections and sepsis. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between gut flora and surgical outcomes.","Yes, surgical complications can be related to the gut flora. The gut flora, also known as the gut microbiota, refers to the trillions of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract. These microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining gut health and overall well-being. However, disruptions to the gut flora, such as those caused by surgical procedures, can potentially lead to complications.

Surgical interventions can disrupt the natural balance of the gut flora due to factors like anesthesia, antibiotic use, and changes in diet. This disruption can result in an overgrowth of harmful bacteria or a decrease in beneficial bacteria, leading to a condition called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis can contribute to various surgical complications, including surgical site infections, anastomotic leaks, and postoperative sepsis.

Furthermore, the gut flora has been found to influence the immune system, metabolism, and wound healing processes. Alterations in the gut flora can impair these functions, potentially increasing the risk of surgical complications.

It is important for healthcare professionals to consider the impact of surgical interventions on the gut flora and take appropriate measures to minimize disruptions. This may include the use of targeted antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics to restore and maintain a healthy gut microbiota during the perioperative period.","The papers suggest that there may be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications. Lederer 2017 found that surgical procedures tended to result in an increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, and that the rate of infectious complications was lower in patients treated with probiotics/symbiotics compared to control groups. Mandal 1988 also noted that intestinal microflora is one of the factors that regulate postoperative septic complications related to intestinal injury. Shi 2022 reviewed evidence outlining the role of gut microbiota in complications of gastrointestinal surgery, especially malabsorption, anastomotic leak, pouchitis, and infections. Stavrou 2016 presented the latest data on the interrelationship between the gut microbiome and the occurrence of complications after colon surgery, and the efficacy of probiotics as therapeutic instruments for changing the bacterial imbalance. However, due to methodological shortcomings of the included studies and uncontrolled bias/confounding factors, there remains a high level of uncertainty."," Multiple articles provide evidence suggesting a relationship between gut flora and surgical complications. The gut microbiota is implicated in postoperative complications such as sepsis, anastomotic leak, and infections [1,3,8,14]. Studies also highlight the potential role of gut flora in specific surgical diseases of infancy and childhood [2], and in conditions such as Hirschsprung's-associated enterocolitis and Crohn's disease [11,16]. A randomized controlled trial found that oral administration of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BBG-01) in pediatric surgical cases significantly decreased postoperative infectious complications and improved the intestinal environment [4]. Another randomized controlled trial on colorectal surgery patients showed significant changes in fecal bacteria proportions with probiotic intervention, although it did not significantly affect the incidence of postoperative infectious complications [6]. A study on liver transplant patients found that disruption of the gut microbial balance may not effectively reduce the risk of postoperative infection [8]. There is also evidence suggesting that probiotics can improve gut barrier function and modulate the immune system, although more large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings [5]. 

"," There is evidence suggesting that the gut flora may be related to surgical complications, but further large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

"," A number of studies suggest a relationship between surgical complications and gut flora. Changes in gut flora in critically ill patients are associated with nosocomial infections and may impact mortality [1]. Gut flora plays a role in surgical diseases of infancy and childhood, contributing to conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease [2]. The concept of ""gut origin sepsis"" has been proposed, linking surgical complications and gut flora [3]. A case study highlighted a patient with Crohn's disease who experienced sepsis due to gut flora pathogens [4]. The importance of maintaining gut flora through enteral nutrition to prevent bacterial translocation was discussed in cancer patients [5]. An animal study suggested gut microbiota modulation could alleviate sleep-restriction induced immunosuppression post-surgery [6]. Another study found that severe postoperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, were more common in patients with stent colonization by E. coli and Enterococcus [7]. An animal study on rats undergoing cardiac surgery found that surgery induced dysbiosis in the gut microbiome, which was accompanied by damage to the gut barrier and increased blood-brain barrier permeability [8].

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes: new ideal method for differentiation of ITB and CD? A meta analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
There are few widely accepted criteria other than caseation, which has low sensitivity, for differentiating intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD).

OBJECTIVE:
We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the use of confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes as histological methods for differentiating ITB and CD, compared with that of caseation.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Database for all relevant studies on the histological differentiation of ITB and CD. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated for each study. Study quality and heterogeneity were assessed. Meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed.

RESULTS:
Ten randomized trials involving 316 ITB and 376 CD patients were included. The results showed that analysis of caseation showed an overall weighted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9966, overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.21 and 1.00, respectively, with a positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of 10.79, negative likelihood ratio(-LR) of 0.82 and DOR of 13.74. Confluent granulomas had a lower overall weighted AUC of 0.9381, sensitivity and specificity were 0.38 and 0.99, respectively, with a +LR of 16.29, -LR of 0.65 and DOR of 26.52. Overall weighted AUC for ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes was 0.9017, sensitivity and specificity were 0.41 and 0.94, respectively, with a +LR of 6.46, -LR of 0.54 and DOR of 13.17. Significant heterogeneity was noted for the studies. Meta-regression analysis showed that study source, publication year, size, design and quality did not affect heterogeneity.

CONCLUSION:
Confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes are helpful in distinguishing ITB from CD, which may provide a new method, other than caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli, to differentiate ITB and CD in mucosal biopsies.","We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the use of confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes as histological methods for differentiating ITB and CD, compared with that of caseation.","We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Database for all relevant studies on the histological differentiation of ITB and CD.

Histopathological features such as confluent granulomas, > or =10 granulomas per biopsy site, and caseous necrosis in biopsy samples were found to reliably differentiate between ITB and CD [1]. Other features observed more often in ITB than CD included granulomas exceeding 0.05 mm(2), ulcers lined by conglomerate epithelioid histiocytes, and disproportionate submucosal inflammation [1][2].

In ITB cases, the tissue may feature caseating granulomas typically with central necrosis surrounded by epithelioid histiocytic cells, Langerhans giant cells, and lymphocytic infiltration. In CD cases, the biopsy may show ulceration, epidermal hyperplasia, and a dermal infiltrate of inflammatory cells, neutrophils, small lymphocytes, histocytes, and large lymphoid cells. Additionally, long term chronic inflammatory cell and granulomatous inflammation may be present with Granuloma Annulare lesions featuring palizading histiocytes and lymphocytes surrounding an area of necrobiotic collagen.",0.8463674187660217,0.3043478260869565,0.27980340264650283,34.62078212490636,0.184,1.0,0.0,0.6318424771813785,0.3340550524944381,0.8201945424079895,0.2014388489208633,0.16523478174234332,21.355061404427786,0.08860759493670886,1.0,0.0,0.5481605014336184,0.3091470170484801,0.7904846668243408,0.14285714285714285,0.08617325702393341,12.965619129752628,0.0537525354969574,1.0,0.0,0.5101470937924598,0.294809348123595,0.798762321472168,0.13612565445026176,0.10200899133040965,15.072329820034694,0.04263565891472868,1.0,0.0,0.5140781262641624,0.29795493064054523,0.8649173974990845,0.36585365853658536,0.28812370062370063,42.64025768334258,0.23157894736842105,0.7203017832647463,0.0,0.6763620407723668,0.3520009291860419,0.7708326578140259,0.15596330275229356,0.09026968374491885,13.452872387119552,0.04477611940298507,1.0,0.0,0.47988575170732567,0.2795700780316216,0.7718567252159119,0.14857142857142858,0.08867641198754818,15.137550297174302,0.04177897574123989,1.0,0.0,0.4649645746508731,0.2752386877938273,0.8690367937088013,0.33333333333333337,0.3546348314606741,44.0216555543249,0.20114942528735633,0.7997256515775034,0.0,0.7075148737821423,0.35765522524784904,0.7970283627510071,0.18666666666666665,0.11000492853622473,17.832950634852004,0.07630979498861047,1.0,0.0,0.5404190789339907,0.30686333575403313,0.8013029098510742,0.23204419889502761,0.11955316856879672,22.763795286753037,0.09230769230769231,1.0,0.0,0.5478256665847518,0.3078413025449981,0.8537604212760925,0.32911392405063294,0.28781431334622826,44.94436798089972,0.1941747572815534,0.6584362139917695,0.0,0.6504536369017192,0.34530670662198604,0.7892568111419678,0.17073170731707318,0.09796533534287867,17.352620347691857,0.04838709677419355,1.0,0.0,0.5350432769924987,0.29305213281519504,0.8248211741447449,0.189873417721519,0.1426964236714534,18.26377150215158,0.07090909090909091,1.0,0.0,0.5868058641571804,0.3182958714862583
gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Does adjuvant hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy improve patient outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma following liver resection? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Adjuvant hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been shown to be beneficial to the patient outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

METHODS:
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were identified from six databases up to January 26, 2023. Patient outcomes were assessed using overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Data were presented as hazard ratios (HR, 95% confidence intervals, or CIs).

RESULTS:
The present systematic review included 2 RCTs and 9 non-RCTs with a total of 1290 cases. Adjuvant HAIC improved OS (HR of 0.69; 95% CI of 0.56-0.84; pâ<â0.01) and DFS (HR of 0.64; 95% CI of 0.49-0.83; pâ<â0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that HCC patients with portal vein invasion (PVI) or microvascular invasion (MVI) benefit from adjuvant HAIC in terms of OS ((HR of 0.43; 95% CI of 0.19-0.95; pâ<â0.01) and (HR of 0.43; 95% CI of 0.19-0.95; pâ=â0.0373), respectively) and DFS ((HR of 0.38; 95% CI of 0.21-0.69; pâ<â0.01) and (HR of 0.73; 95% CI of 0.60-0.88; pâ=â0.0125), respectively). Adjuvant HAIC with the oxaliplatin-based approach significantly improved OS (HR of 0.60; 95% CI of 0.36-0.84; pâ=â0.02) and (HR of 0.59; 95% CI of 0.43-0.75; pâ<â0.01), respectively).

","Studies have shown that surgery (resection or transplant) is the only proven curative approach for treating most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Transplantation can achieve a relapse-free survival of 80% and a 4-year overall survival rate of 75%. In terms of adjuvant therapy, the Adjuvant Treatment in the Prevention of Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (STORM) trial demonstrated that sorafenib had no benefit in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and thus neoadjuvant therapy is not a recommended standard of care at this time.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,"Can ""no-touch"" radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma improve local tumor control? Systematic review and meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES:
Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but local tumor progression (LTP) has been a main limitation of RFA. This study aims to evaluate the LTP of percutaneous no-touch RFA (NtRFA) for HCC â¤ 5 cm and compare with conventional RFA (intratumoral puncture) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on percutaneous NtRFA for HCC â¤ 5 cm. The pooled proportions of the overall and cumulative incidence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years for LTP after NtRFA were assessed using a random-effects model. For studies comparing NtRFA with conventional RFA, relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were meta-analytically pooled with LTP as the outcome.

RESULTS:
Twelve studies with 900 patients were included. The pooled overall rate of LTP after NtRFA was 6% (95% CI, 4-8%). The pooled 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence rates of LTP were 3% (95% CI, 2-5%), 5% (95% CI, 3- 9%), and 8% (95% CI, 6-11%), respectively. Compared to conventional RFA, the pooled RR and HR of LTP were 0.26 (95% CI, 0.16-0.41) and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.11-0.70), respectively (both p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis including only randomized controlled studies also showed better local tumor control of NtRFA with HR of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.14-0.42).

CONCLUSIONS:
Percutaneous NtRFA is an effective treatment for HCC â¤ 5 cm with an overall LTP rate of 6% and provides lower LTP compared with conventional RFA.

RFA is a minimally invasive procedure that uses heat generated by radiofrequency waves to destroy cancer cells. The ""no-touch"" technique involves creating a margin of ablation around the tumor without directly touching it, which helps to minimize the risk of tumor seeding and local tumor recurrence. Several studies have shown that ""no-touch"" RFA can achieve better local tumor control and lower rates of local tumor recurrence compared to conventional RFA techniques. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of ""no-touch"" RFA may vary depending on the size and location of the tumor, as well as individual patient factors. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.","The papers suggest that ""no-touch"" radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and may improve local tumor control. Kawamura 2018 found that no-touch pincer ablation using bipolar electrodes had the potential to prevent intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence to the same degree as surgical resection. Kawamura 2014 investigated the utility of a no-touch pincer ablation procedure that uses a multipolar RFA system for a tumor located on the liver surface. Kawamura 2017 clarified the usefulness of a no-touch pincer ablation procedure that uses bipolar electrodes to prevent intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence after RFA for patients with HCC. Malla 2021 described a case report of a subcapsular HCC that was successfully treated with no-touch ablation.

","No-touch radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may offer improved local tumor control for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although RFA is commonly used as an adjunct to or alternative to resection, some studies have suggested that it may be best used as a sole treatment for certain cases of HCC--particularly those with tumors of 3 cm or smaller. Other ablation techniques, such as microwave and cryotherapy, have also been used to treat HCC, but studies to date have not shown marked differences in terms of survival time from diagnosis, local recurrence, or mortality. Pre-operative portal vein embolization can improve the patient’s reserve before surgery by redirecting venous flow to the non-diseased liver remnant. Transarterial chemoembolization may provide a survival benefit for small tumors (less than 2 cm), but comes with its own set of contraindications and relative limiting factors. Other thermal ablation therapies, such as PEI or radiation therapy, are also available, though without clear guidelines for their use. Overall, RFA appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for certain cases of HCC that can improve local tumor control and reduce morbidity and mortality compared to traditional resection.",0.7402756810188293,0.10256410256410256,0.047479912344777206,9.421589274315815,0.020338983050847456,1.0,0.0,0.4430093197403727,0.2522463060157483,0.7439836859703064,0.11267605633802817,0.07112810707456979,15.07798698693154,0.028037383177570093,1.0,0.0,0.46734642386436465,0.244989721124727,0.7258079051971436,0.07920792079207921,0.05504439094774337,5.87220424718944,0.01918158567774936,1.0,0.0,0.4194896266631344,0.24403632155311844,0.7375580072402954,0.0935672514619883,0.06711912531948938,7.001233039960518,0.0219435736677116,1.0,0.0,0.44356533284910127,0.25424397840516694,0.7311844229698181,0.03703703703703704,0.04746835443037975,16.18642672760328,0.02459016393442623,1.0,0.0,0.43731441964273865,0.2253615071316474,0.7415764331817627,0.08372093023255814,0.042907622412922765,6.394528092299994,0.019721577726218097,1.0,0.0,0.4303037128881445,0.2572406690758378,0.7526822686195374,0.09625668449197859,0.0504750593824228,7.343139615033202,0.023287671232876714,1.0,0.0,0.452009831608712,0.26666192867701377,0.7379898428916931,0.0784313725490196,0.051903114186851215,16.680725324066486,0.02727272727272727,1.0,0.0,0.4529152687002973,0.23099387598065915,0.7275766730308533,0.08058608058608058,0.03420523138832998,5.3941611662302495,0.015370705244122965,1.0,0.0,0.42360846812282105,0.25198406209676594,0.7309425473213196,0.09090909090909091,0.04568430787874922,6.194478746729615,0.017598343685300208,1.0,0.0,0.4380198009777814,0.2582871512344489,0.7503615021705627,0.03703703703703704,0.048859934853420196,17.93009001230829,0.025423728813559324,1.0,0.0,0.46515747977466115,0.2422244548752898,0.7282259464263916,0.10588235294117647,0.0649149726183008,8.227787770884692,0.029900332225913623,1.0,0.0,0.45031354296098064,0.2530576798392421,0.7597428560256958,0.10091743119266056,0.050271271854404574,6.805739671027154,0.019002375296912115,1.0,0.0,0.4704757887703269,0.27078655467356944
gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Is there an association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cognitive function? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is represented as the most common liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors underpinned by insulin resistance, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, leading to extrahepatic changes in central nervous diseases such as cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The aim of the review is to explore the association between NAFLD and cognitive function.

METHODS:
Using the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic electronic literature search was conducted in four databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase and CINAHL from inception until March 2021. Neuropsychological tests utilised within each study were grouped into relevant cognitive domains including 'general cognition', 'reasoning', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', 'memory and learning', 'language', 'visuospatial perception' and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'.

RESULTS:
Eleven observational studies that involved 7978 participants with a mean age of 51âyears were included. Those with NAFLD had poor cognitive performance in three cognitive domains, including 'general cognition', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'.

CONCLUSION:
The observed results from the 11 included studies showed that NAFLD was associated with lower cognitive performance across several domains. However, studies conducted to date are limited to observational designs and are heterogeneous with varying diagnostic tools used to assess cognitive function.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Does moderate alcohol consumption accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD? A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"OBJECTIVES:
Liver disease is a leading cause of premature death, partly driven by the increasing incidence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Many people with a diagnosis of NAFLD drink moderate amounts of alcohol. There is limited guidance for clinicians looking to advise these patients on the effect this will have on their liver disease progression. This review synthesises the evidence on moderate alcohol consumption and its potential to predict liver disease progression in people with diagnosed NAFLD.

METHODS:
A systematic review of longitudinal observational cohort studies was conducted. Databases (Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched up to September 2020. Studies were included that reported progression of liver disease in adults with NAFLD, looking at moderate levels of alcohol consumption as the exposure of interest. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic factor Studies tool.

RESULTS:
Of 4578 unique citations, 6 met the inclusion criteria. Pooling of data was not possible due to heterogeneity and studies were analysed using narrative synthesis. Evidence suggested that any level of alcohol consumption is associated with worsening of liver outcomes in NAFLD, even for drinking within recommended limits. Well conducted population based studies estimated up to a doubling of incident liver disease outcomes in patients with NAFLD drinking at moderate levels.

CONCLUSIONS:
This review found that any level of alcohol intake in NAFLD may be harmful to liver health.Study heterogeneity in definitions of alcohol exposure as well as in outcomes limited quantitative pooling of results. Use of standardised definitions for exposure and outcomes would support future meta-analysis.Based on this synthesis of the most up to date longitudinal evidence, clinicians seeing patients with NAFLD should currently advise abstinence from alcohol.

Other studies suggest that light to moderate alcohol consumption may have a protective effect on the development of NAFLD [1][7][15], but these protective effects are not consistently observed, particularly in individuals with established NAFLD [4][9][10][15][17]. There is also evidence to suggest that alcohol and obesity may have combined pathological effects on liver disease progression [13]. Despite the mixed findings, many studies and reviews advise against alcohol consumption in NAFLD patients due to the potential risk of liver disease progression [3][5][10][16].

"," The current evidence is mixed and unclear, but there is a suggestion that moderate alcohol consumption may accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD, and many studies advise against alcohol consumption in these patients.

","No, moderate alcohol consumption does not accelerate the progression of liver disease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is a slowly progressive disease with steatosis being reversible and non-progressive. The risk of developing hepatic cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma is minimal in those with few or no cases of cirrhosis. Metabolic derangements like obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and decreased insulin sensitivity are risk factors for NAFLD. The diagnosis of NAFLD involves the presence of steatosis in 5% or greater of hepatocytes and recommending a NAFLD fibrosis score and radiological imaging.",0.8509746193885803,0.22388059701492538,0.22412012171124276,33.694425586107855,0.10909090909090909,1.0,0.0,0.6730553710583559,0.34040061024511997,0.8121087551116943,0.1568627450980392,0.1761252446183953,35.26312840102979,0.07317073170731707,0.7342105263157894,0.0,0.6105134433410206,0.3047109333949892,0.7904416918754578,0.18118466898954702,0.08929414963603725,15.934650882351248,0.050274223034734916,1.0,0.0,0.5344457481958851,0.30030939114832,0.7961803078651428,0.1957446808510638,0.12817301269205075,19.624610682483283,0.06323185011709602,1.0,0.0,0.5417289703609459,0.3041957705041714,0.8285952210426331,0.22018348623853212,0.2824944690265487,40.56151213986501,0.11788617886178862,0.8448830409356725,0.0,0.6119921726710869,0.3176662214733571,0.7617258429527283,0.14482758620689656,0.07967979010450052,15.543513300830499,0.03902439024390244,1.0,0.0,0.4702976448405646,0.27821390208263574,0.7601956129074097,0.14457831325301204,0.09326604756053974,18.27918045339799,0.04397705544933078,1.0,0.0,0.46597381628919066,0.27723317270410885,0.8238385915756226,0.18367346938775514,0.2791023953464543,39.39304887496744,0.08943089430894309,0.6744360902255638,0.0,0.6171081506393172,0.3186785978701163,0.7580028772354126,0.15217391304347824,0.081929234273441,16.060125932490624,0.03646677471636953,1.0,0.0,0.4799192604012118,0.2825463990126824,0.7534164786338806,0.16736401673640167,0.089508356921418,18.798852958490954,0.040337711069418386,1.0,0.0,0.4699585721876382,0.2790694501638706,0.8414624333381653,0.2340425531914894,0.33069155846387555,44.05107876078731,0.0975609756097561,0.6921052631578948,0.0,0.674754785001278,0.33399301356433864,0.8477302193641663,0.27692307692307694,0.19218535685856133,27.378238145556395,0.1456140350877193,1.0,0.0,0.6334140418988207,0.34109574652230634,0.7791044116020203,0.1456953642384106,0.14618468964856382,25.74753681319984,0.06896551724137931,1.0,0.0,0.5041096725066503,0.2768728151330459
gastroenterology,inflammatory bowel disease,Is diversion free ileal pouch-anal anastomosis a safe procedure? A meta-analysis of 4973 cases.,"PURPOSE:
Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been established as the procedure of choice for patients who require excision of the colon and rectum for familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis. The requirement for proximal stomal diversion in IPAA is controversial.

OBJECTIVES:
To compare post-operative outcomes following IPAA with and without proximal diversion.

METHODS:
Computerised literature search, of Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE. Full-text comparative studies published between 1992 and 2019, in English language and on adult patients. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with or without proximal stomal diversion following proctocolectomy. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, anastomosis strictures, re-operations, pouch failure, intra-abdominal sepsis, small bowel obstruction/ileus and mortality.

RESULTS:
Five hundred and forty-six studies were screened. Fourteen relevant studies included 4973 cases (1832 patients with no stomas vs 3141 with stomas). Anastomotic strictures (pÂ â¤Â 0.0001 OR 0.40; 95% CI (0.26-0.62)) and pouch failures (pâ=â0.003 OR 0.54; 95% CI (0.36-0.82)) were higher in diverted than non-diverted patients. Re-operation was more frequently required in non-diverted patients (pÂ =â0.02 OR 2.51; 95% CI (1.12-5.59)). Heterogeneity was low in 5 out of 7 variables.

CONCLUSION:
In selected patients, diversion-free IPAA is a safe procedure associated with lower anastomotic stricture and pouch failure rates than diverted IPAA. This appears to occur at the expense of a higher re-operation rate. An RCT is required to help define the selection criteria.",To compare post-operative outcomes following IPAA with and without proximal diversion.,"Computerised literature search, of Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE.

","The Single anastomosis duodenoileal bypass (SBDI) is a safe procedure for weight loss that is generally similar to other weight loss procedures, such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy for cytomegalovirus after liver transplantation?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
To conduct a meta-analysis with the aim of comparing the outcomes of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients.

METHODS:
We searched databases for qualified studies up until March 2022. Finally, a meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
With a total of 1834 LT patients, the pooled incidence of CMV infection and CMV disease in the overall LT recipients using antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy were 24.7% vs. 40.4% and 6.4% vs. 9.4%, respectively. Our meta-analysis exhibited a significant reduction in the incidence of CMV infection due to antiviral prophylaxis when compared to preemptive therapy in the high-risk group (OR: 6.67, 95% CI: 1.73, 25.66; p = 0.006). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of late-onset of CMV disease in preemptive therapy compared to antiviral prophylaxis in the high-risk group (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.74; p = 0.009). However, the incidence of CMV disease, allograft rejection, graft loss, drug related adverse effects, opportunistic infections and mortality did not differ significantly between both the interventions (all p> 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
We found the use of antiviral prophylaxis, compared with preemptive therapy, is superior in controlling CMV infection and prolonging the time to CMV disease in LT recipients without an increased risk of opportunistic infections, allograft rejection, graft loss, drug related adverse effects, development of drug resistance, and mortality.",To conduct a meta-analysis with the aim of comparing the outcomes of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients.,"We searched databases for qualified studies up until March 2022.

Antiviral prophylaxis involves administering antiviral medication to all at-risk patients for a set period after transplantation, regardless of whether they show signs of CMV infection. This approach can effectively prevent CMV disease, but it may lead to antiviral resistance and does not completely eliminate the risk of late-onset disease.

Preemptive therapy, on the other hand, involves regular monitoring of CMV levels in the blood after transplantation. Antiviral treatment is started only when the virus is detected. This approach can reduce the use of antiviral medication and the risk of antiviral resistance, but it requires frequent monitoring and may not prevent all cases of CMV disease.

The choice between antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy depends on various factors, including the patient's risk of CMV disease, the resources available for monitoring, and the potential side effects of antiviral medication. It's a decision that should be made by the healthcare team in consultation with the patient.","Antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for cytomegalovirus (CMV) after liver transplantation. This is because CMV infection is a common complication in liver transplant recipients and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic antiviral therapy, typically with drugs such as valganciclovir or ganciclovir, is initiated immediately after transplantation and continued for a specified duration, usually 3 to 6 months. The goal of prophylaxis is to prevent CMV reactivation or primary infection in seronegative recipients. Preemptive therapy, on the other hand, involves monitoring CMV viral load and initiating antiviral treatment only when there is evidence of active CMV replication. The choice between prophylaxis and preemptive therapy may depend on various factors, including the recipient's CMV serostatus, the risk of CMV infection, and the center's protocols. Ultimately, the decision should be made in consultation with the transplant team and based on individual patient characteristics.","The papers suggest that antiviral prophylaxis is more effective than preemptive therapy for preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in high-risk liver transplant recipients. Yadav 2022 found that antiviral prophylaxis reduced the incidence of CMV infection compared to preemptive therapy in high-risk patients. Bodro 2012 also found that prophylaxis was more effective than preemptive therapy in preventing CMV disease in donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative (D+/R-) liver recipients. However, Lindner 2016 found that CMV prophylaxis can cause leukopenia, which is a disadvantage.

","Patients who receive organ transplants from CMV-infected donors should receive prophylactic treatment with valganciclovir or ganciclovir, and regular serological monitoring. Following corneal transplantation, highly suspected CMV endotheliitis should be treated with ant-CMV therapy such as oral valganciclovir with or without topical ganciclovir and systemic or topical corticosteroids. For other organ transplants, primary prophylaxis for a minimum of 6 months is recommended, while some patients, such as those with a history of PCP infection or chronic CMV infection, need to be on lifelong prophylaxis. For liver transplantation, antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy is recommended.",0.793190062046051,0.2112211221122112,0.26003229195854805,43.66926922446373,0.1267806267806268,0.8967537864360714,0.0,0.5935451682164984,0.3009799336936088,0.8098816871643066,0.22754491017964074,0.2632367182604509,42.719451090541604,0.15415549597855227,0.9680045564191906,0.0,0.6309133088293154,0.3136448729698708,0.8308247923851013,0.27027027027027023,0.28236952675807164,42.85287676834022,0.17320261437908496,1.0,0.0,0.6520870587764642,0.3357274704442976,0.8354024291038513,0.2779456193353474,0.31553570544797893,47.71289324304947,0.19733333333333333,0.886974001608148,0.0,0.6689900899118231,0.339910500911355,0.7670997977256775,0.1319796954314721,0.24255725190839691,30.5047886390935,0.038461538461538464,0.8625419981135526,0.0,0.6155703633415456,0.2815959097876706,0.8146467804908752,0.24083769633507854,0.21446970041886726,40.25754354678605,0.12925851703406813,1.0,0.0,0.6160876297026184,0.32472140175549924,0.8113879561424255,0.24096385542168675,0.22482943510976713,41.59306377284878,0.13517060367454067,0.9251021414482953,0.0,0.6190125635057165,0.32050418758704946,0.7813564538955688,0.14423076923076922,0.3107650463900503,38.79906254559457,0.05555555555555555,0.8421513077159073,0.0,0.6361195406743458,0.2933152229030231,0.8471924662590027,0.25663716814159293,0.24497031231146676,36.48423174580946,0.1592,1.0,0.0,0.6795546723618394,0.34920519509516407,0.8503549695014954,0.27499999999999997,0.2969360423193086,42.1728339711448,0.18762088974854932,1.0,0.0,0.6916415673563848,0.3519413627885945,0.7932894229888916,0.14285714285714285,0.26134514608408516,38.73194326653053,0.04415954415954416,0.8063795588706356,0.0,0.6648972336616781,0.305377994889129,0.8218005895614624,0.26373626373626374,0.28217373874344054,47.76707392408429,0.1225071225071225,0.7640805410974267,0.0,0.6695140830932125,0.3275149892707291,0.7653698921203613,0.12549019607843137,0.18333486685927752,36.493541447573264,0.05128205128205128,0.7836705976949879,0.0,0.5591596518793414,0.27929306161863465
gastroenterology,liver transplantation,What is the optimal anesthetic monitoring regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after liver transplantation?-A systematic review of the literature and expert panel recommendations.,"BACKGROUND:
Liver transplant centers vary in approach to intraoperative vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and temperature management. Evidence is limited regarding impact of selected modalities on postoperative outcomes.

OBJECTIVES:
To review the literature and provide expert panel recommendations on optimal intraoperative arterial blood pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), and vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and intraoperative temperature management regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

METHODS:
Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and recommendations using the GRADE approach derived from an international expert panel. Recommendations made for: (1) Vascular accesses, arterial BP and CVP monitoring, (2) cardiac function monitoring, and (3) Intraoperative temperature management (CRD42021239908).

RESULTS:
Of 2619 articles screened 16 were included. Studies were small, retrospective, and observational. Vascular access studies demonstrated low rates of insertion complications. TEE studies demonstrated low rates of esophageal hemorrhage. One study found lower hospital-LOS and 30-day mortality in patients monitored with both PAC and TEE. Other monitoring studies were heterogenous in design and outcomes. Temperature studies showed increased blood transfusion and ventilation times in hypothermic groups.

CONCLUSIONS:
Recommendations were made for; routine arterial and CVP monitoring as a minimum standard of practice, consideration of discrepancy between peripheral and central arterial BP in patients with hemodynamic instability and high vasopressor requirements, and routine use of high flow cannulae while monitoring for extravasation and hematoma formation. Availability and expertise in PAC and/or TEE monitoring is strongly recommended particularly in hemodynamic instability, portopulmonary HT and/or cardiac dysfunction. TEE use is recommended as an acceptable risk in patients with treated esophageal varices and is an effective diagnostic tool for emergency cardiovascular collapse. Maintenance of intraoperative normothermia is strongly recommended.","To review the literature and provide expert panel recommendations on optimal intraoperative arterial blood pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), and vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and intraoperative temperature management regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).","Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and recommendations using the GRADE approach derived from an international expert panel.

Hemodynamic monitoring involves the use of invasive arterial pressure monitoring, central venous pressure monitoring, and cardiac output monitoring. This helps in assessing the patient's cardiovascular status and guiding fluid and vasoactive drug therapy. 

Respiratory monitoring includes continuous pulse oximetry and capnography, which help in assessing the patient's oxygenation and ventilation status. 

Neurological monitoring may involve the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the patient's level of consciousness and detect any signs of cerebral hypoxia or ischemia. 

In addition, monitoring of blood gases, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters is essential to detect and manage metabolic and coagulation abnormalities. 

It's important to note that the choice of monitoring techniques may vary depending on the patient's condition and the specific circumstances of the surgery. The goal is to ensure the patient's safety and optimize their physiological status during and after the transplantation procedure.","The optimal anesthetic monitoring for immediate and short-term outcomes after liver transplantation includes continuous monitoring of vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels. Additionally, monitoring of central venous pressure, arterial blood gas analysis, and coagulation parameters is important. Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure may be necessary in some cases. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and urine output is also essential. The use of advanced monitoring techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography and near-infrared spectroscopy can provide additional information on cardiac function and tissue oxygenation. Regular assessment of liver function tests and early detection of complications such as graft dysfunction or rejection are crucial for optimal outcomes.","These papers suggest that there is no clear consensus on the optimal anesthetic monitoring for immediate and short-term outcomes after liver transplantation.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Are We Ready for Bariatric Surgery in a Liver Transplant Program? A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are two main causes of end-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplantation. Studies exploring bariatric surgery in the liver transplantation setting have increased in recent years; however, a systematic analysis of the topic is lacking to date. This meta-analysis was conducted to explore the perioperative and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese patients undergoing liver transplantation.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies reporting bariatric surgery in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The primary outcomes were postoperative complications and mortality. We also extracted data about excess weight loss, body mass index, and improvement of comorbidities after bariatric surgery.

RESULTS:
A total of 96 patients from 8 articles were included. Bariatric surgery-related morbidity and mortality rates were 37% (95% CI 0.27-0.47) and 0.6% (95% CI 0.02-0.13), respectively. Body mass index at 24Â months was 31.02 (95% CI 25.96-36.09) with a percentage excess weight loss at 12 and 24Â months of 44.08 (95% CI 27.90-60.26) and 49.2 (95% CI 31.89-66.66), respectively. After bariatric surgery, rates of improvement of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 61% (95% CI 0.45-0.75) and 45% (95% CI 0.25-0.66), respectively. In most patients, bariatric surgery was performed after liver transplant and the most frequent technique was sleeve gastrectomy.

Several factors need to be taken into account to determine if a patient is ready for bariatric surgery in this setting. These factors include the patient's overall health, liver function, and the potential impact of bariatric surgery on the liver transplant process.

Bariatric surgery is typically recommended for individuals with severe obesity who have not been successful with other weight loss methods. However, in the context of a liver transplant program, additional considerations arise. Liver transplant recipients often have compromised liver function and may be at higher risk for complications related to surgery and anesthesia.

Before considering bariatric surgery in a liver transplant program, it is crucial to assess the patient's liver function and overall health. This evaluation may involve liver function tests, imaging studies, and consultations with hepatologists and transplant surgeons.

Additionally, the potential impact of bariatric surgery on the liver transplant process must be carefully evaluated. Bariatric surgery can lead to significant weight loss, which may improve a patient's overall health and make them a better candidate for liver transplantation. However, it is essential to consider the potential impact of weight loss on the patient's nutritional status and the potential need for adjustments in immunosuppressive medications.

In conclusion, the decision to perform bariatric surgery in a liver transplant program requires a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall health, liver function, and the potential impact on the liver transplant process. It is crucial to involve a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including hepatologists, transplant surgeons, and bariatric surgeons, to make an informed decision.","The papers suggest that bariatric surgery can be performed safely in the setting of liver transplantation, resulting in improvement of obesity-related comorbidities.

","This text examines whether or not we are ready for bariatric surgery in a liver transplant program. It is important to note that a patient must have an optimized health and functional status prior to bariatric surgery as it is an elective procedure. Patients' BMI should be evaluated, and a referral to a dietician is recommended for those with a BMI above 30 kg/m^2. Also essential is to ensure that patients are ready to adhere to postoperative nutritional restrictions once they enter the bariatric surgery program. Alternative methods to aid in weight loss, such as intragastric balloon therapy, can be utilized for those with a BMI over 50 kg/m^2 and are at higher risk for anesthesia- and technical-related complications.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Does adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy improve outcome of biliary atresia? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The role of adjuvant steroid therapy in the postoperative management of patients with biliary atresia (BA) is unclear.

OBJECTIVE:
To systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) on BA outcome.

METHODS:
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials andâor observational studies that examined the role of steroids on BA outcomes published between January 1969 and June 2010 was conducted. Studies were identified using the Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases.

RESULTS:
Sixteen observational studies and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were found. Four of the 16 observational studies (160 participants) and the RCT (73 participants) met the entry criteria and were eligible to be included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the effect of steroids either on normalizing serum bilirubin levels at six months (pooled OR 1.48 [95% CI 0.67 to 3.28]) or in delaying the need for early liver transplantation (within the first year post-KP (pooled OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.21 to 1.72]).

CONCLUSION:
The present meta-analysis did not find a significant effect of steroid over standard therapy, either in normalizing serum bilirubin levels at six months or at delaying the need for early liver transplantation post-KP. RCT studies of sufficient size and comprehensive design using high-dose steroids are needed to determine the effectiveness of steroids on the short and intermediate post-KP outcomes for BA patients.",To systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) on BA outcome.,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials andâor observational studies that examined the role of steroids on BA outcomes published between January 1969 and June 2010 was conducted.

"," The use of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy in patients with biliary atresia (BA) has been examined in several studies with varying results. Some studies have found that steroid therapy is associated with improved clearance of postoperative jaundice and lower serum bilirubin levels [1,4,7,8,9,11,12]. However, these studies also reported that steroid therapy did not significantly impact the incidence of cholangitis, the need for liver transplantation, and overall survival [1,4,7,8,9,11,12]. A study with a larger sample size found that perioperative steroid use was associated with a decreased postoperative length of stay [3]. However, these studies were mostly retrospective in design, and many lacked control groups, which may introduce bias and limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions [1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,15]. Some studies suggested that a prospective study with a standardized dose and length of steroid administration and longer follow-up is recommended for more accurate assessment [1,4]. One study suggested that the initial response to steroids does not necessarily predict the final outcome [8]. Another study suggested that liver transplantation and aggressive corticosteroid therapy contribute to better survival in BA patients [9].

TL;DR: Current evidence suggests that adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy may improve clearance of postoperative jaundice and lower serum bilirubin levels in patients with biliary atresia, but it does not appear to significantly impact the incidence of cholangitis, the need for liver transplantation, and overall survival. Further prospective studies with standardized protocols are needed to confirm these findings.

Several studies have demonstrated that the use of steroids after the Kasai procedure can lead to improved bile flow, decreased incidence of cholangitis, and increased survival rates in infants with biliary atresia. Steroids help reduce inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, which can improve the long-term prognosis for these patients. However, it is important to note that the optimal timing, dosage, and duration of steroid therapy are still being investigated, and individual patient factors should be considered when determining the appropriateness of this treatment.","The papers have mixed findings on whether adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy improves the outcome of biliary atresia.

However, Zhang 2016 found that steroid usage increased the clearance rates of jaundice at 6 months and 1 year after KPE, but not at 2 years. Escobar 2006 found that steroids significantly improved clearance of postoperative jaundice and lower serum bilirubin levels, but had no effect on the incidence of cholangitis, need for liver transplantation, and overall survival. Meyers 2003 found that adjuvant therapy using high-dose steroids, ursodeoxycholic acid, and intravenous antibiotics may accelerate the clearance of jaundice and decrease the need for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy. Overall, the papers suggest that adjuvant steroid therapy may improve short-term clearance rate of jaundice, but its effect on long-term clearance rate of jaundice and native liver survival rate is unclear."," The use of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy in patients with biliary atresia (BA) has been examined in several studies with varying results.

","Biliary atresia is a condition characterized by the obstruction of the bile ducts. It has a dismal outlook with success rate for Kasai porto-enterostomy (the initial treatment for biliary atresia) around 60%. Early diagnosis and referral to a specialty center are essential for increased chances of survival with native liver. Management is best done with an interprofessional team as advances in technique, transplantation, immunosuppression, and medications has improved the 10-year survival rate. To increase awareness, color-coded stool charts and a stool color mobile app have been introduced. Adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy is thought to improve the outcome of biliary atresia, but a single prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial and the START (Steroids in Biliary Atresia Randomized Trial) have not demonstrated any significant survival benefit to this form of therapy. Ursodeoxycholic acid is more commonly used for promoting bile clearance and treatment of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is tailored to the specific etiology. Liver transplant is curative but challenging and Parenteral nutrition-induced cholestasis is managed with cyclic PN and reduced exposure.

gastroenterology,malabsorption syndromes,Is Helicobacter pylori Infection Associated with Celiac Disease? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Some studies have reported the correlation between Helicobacter pylori and celiac disease (CD), but the results lack consistency. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between H. pylori and CD. In addition, the study also analyzed the impact of H. pylori on the symptoms and classification of CD.

METHODS:
Studies published up to September 1, 2020 on 3 databases - EMBASE, MEDICINE, and PubMed - were searched. The statistical data of articles which met the requirements were collated and extracted.

RESULTS:
Twenty-five papers and 141 355 participants were finally enrolled. The results showed that the H. pylori infection rate of CD patients was 0.57 times greater compared to controls (OR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.44, 0.75]), while statistical differences were also seen in the subgroups of children (OR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.33, 0.85]) and adults (OR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.49, 0.81]). Furthermore, patients having CD with H. pylori were more likely to have symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and distension (OR = 2.5, 95% CI [1.35, 4.62]) (OR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.09, 2.24]) (OR = 2.75, 95% CI [1.74, 4.35]). However, H. pylori has no effect on CD classification.

CONCLUSION:
The study confirmed that there is a correlation between H. pylori and CD, but the causality cannot be clarified. A demonstration of a causal role of H. pylori in CD in future prospective studies could have important therapeutic implications.","Some studies have reported the correlation between Helicobacter pylori and celiac disease (CD), but the results lack consistency.

studies have confirmed that there is a correlation between H. pylori and CD, but the causality cannot be clarified. "," The relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) is complex and not fully understood. A study with a strong sample size and design found an inverse relationship between HP infection and CD in children, suggesting that HP infection may confer protection against CD [7]. However, the evidence is not entirely consistent, as another study found a strong positive correlation between CD and HP infection in relation to lymphocytic gastritis, but it did not provide details about the study design, sample size, or risk of bias [5]. In addition, a review article suggested a potential association between HP infection, CD, and migraines, but again, this was not based on original research [15].

gastroenterology,malabsorption syndromes,Does primary lactase deficiency reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"UNLABELLED:
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The role of primary lactase deficiency (PLD) in its development is not clear. This meta-analysis showed that PLD is a risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. These women need special attention in terms of screening for osteoporosis and its prevention.

INTRODUCTION:
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important predictor of bone fractures. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of association of PLD and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.

METHODS:
The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched over the course of July 2017 for any date of publication without language limitation. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the diagnosis of PLD was made by genetic testing or H-2 breath tests and the diagnosis of osteoporosis was made by a modern reliable method for BMD measurement. Two investigators conducted a comprehensive, independent review of all the papers. Five of the studies initially identified met the inclusion criteria. We used MOOSE guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model.

RESULTS:
Five case-control studies with 2223 participants and 763 lactase-deficient cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed a significantly higher bone density Z-score in absorbers (mean difference 0.20, CI (0.14-0.27), Pâ=â0.000), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies. Moreover, the Z-score in the vast majority of the measured sites (femoral head, femoral neck, lumbar spine, radius, and Ward's triangle) was significantly higher in absorbers. There was no significant overall difference in BMD in g/cm<sup>2</sup> between absorbers and non-absorbers, but a significantly higher BMD using g/cm<sup>2</sup> was observed in absorbers in the total hip site.

CONCLUSIONS:
Postmenopausal women with PLD had lower Z-scores at most anatomic sites compared to healthy controls.",Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important predictor of bone fractures.

The study, which included a population-based cohort of 453 women aged between 62-78 years, found no association between LM and LI with reduced BMD or increased risk of fractures, provided that calcium intake from diet and/or supplements remained sufficient. However, the study's findings may be limited due to potential biases, including selection bias and recall bias, and the fact that it did not account for other potential confounding factors that could affect BMD and fractures.

TL;DR: According to the study evidence, primary lactase deficiency does not appear to reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, as long as they maintain sufficient calcium intake [1].

",[16015262],[]," Two cross-sectional studies have investigated the potential link between lactase deficiency and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.

This study also found no significant difference in calcium intake from diet or supplements between the groups [1]. The second study, conducted among adult female twins, found no significant association between lactase deficiency and reduced BMD. Among twin pairs discordant for lactase activity, the lactase-deficient member had greater BMD 54% of the time. When comparing all lactase-deficient individuals to those with normal lactase activity, the differences in BMD were 1% or less at each skeletal site [2].

However, other studies noted that lactase deficiency, particularly the CC genotype, was associated with reduced bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures [4,9]. A meta-analysis suggested that primary lactase deficiency could be a risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, indicating reduced bone mineral density [6]. However, it was also noted that lactose intolerance could lead to increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density, particularly if coupled with impaired vitamin D status and low calcium intake [8]. Furthermore, some studies found that lactose intolerance was associated with certain types of fractures [11]. On the other hand, one study found that lactose reduced intestinal calcium absorption in lactase-deficient subjects, but bone mineral density remained stable with lactose-free calcium supplements [7]. 

TL;DR: Evidence suggests that primary lactase deficiency may reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, particularly if associated with low calcium intake and impaired vitamin D status, but the effect can potentially be mitigated with sufficient calcium intake.

However, it was also noted that lactose intolerance could lead to increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density, particularly if coupled with impaired vitamin D status and low calcium intake [8]. Furthermore, some studies found that lactose intolerance was associated with certain types of fractures [11]. On the other hand, one study found that lactose reduced intestinal calcium absorption in lactase-deficient subjects, but bone mineral density remained stable with lactose-free calcium supplements [7]. 

"," Evidence suggests that primary lactase deficiency may reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, particularly if associated with low calcium intake and impaired vitamin D status, but the effect can potentially be mitigated with sufficient calcium intake. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.

","No, primary lactase deficiency does not reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid reduce the risk of spine, hips, and other nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Additionally, various treatments like hormone therapy, smoking cessation, physical activity, calcium supplementation, and non-hormone treatments such as bisphosphonates and denosumab can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and related injuries. Primary lactase deficiency does not reduce bone mineral density as it is related to decreased estrogen levels that can cause an increased risk of bone fractures due to reduced bone density.",0.7308160066604614,0.10738255033557048,0.18459208400646207,29.345998404987274,0.042222222222222223,0.7386133603238867,0.0,0.5616521348018904,0.24827345729047795,0.7194675207138062,0.11049723756906078,0.13587949357436735,28.488123152690687,0.04666666666666667,0.8790765977443609,0.0,0.516595762094547,0.2425450658670046,0.7466310262680054,0.09166666666666667,0.12513645746496765,23.899521063983524,0.05384615384615385,1.0,0.0,0.5169959643689712,0.2599763460371458,0.7545425295829773,0.10476190476190476,0.14320785597381344,27.02788266463058,0.06573705179282868,0.9238579403053087,0.0,0.5205478456410222,0.2617077549252245,0.7529117465019226,0.06299212598425197,0.17041609416975986,26.818073622220297,0.02,0.8209728867623604,0.0,0.5811846405267715,0.2531198238987633,0.7696199417114258,0.15139442231075695,0.16972104254359588,26.095970929228766,0.07871720116618076,1.0,0.0,0.5646614098603824,0.28345842470744215,0.7774945497512817,0.16593886462882096,0.20296604545119035,29.023205574607214,0.09106529209621993,1.0,0.0,0.5770191626796306,0.2872174110115999,0.7471122145652771,0.06722689075630253,0.15776047261009668,23.914227398648887,0.013333333333333334,0.8710389254385965,0.0,0.6016912789180361,0.2526227772014148,0.7426448464393616,0.1059190031152648,0.10569124838353301,17.429801583672386,0.042743538767395624,1.0,0.0,0.5389805606433323,0.2714009702808263,0.7527096271514893,0.10989010989010989,0.12802403336864404,21.083272316680237,0.05216284987277354,1.0,0.0,0.5587403408619536,0.2777185384549278,0.7412086725234985,0.09655172413793103,0.17546008512723152,29.44038534449017,0.035555555555555556,0.7877541866028708,0.0,0.5455830020123514,0.24502184139418037,0.7811845541000366,0.18994413407821228,0.2594677988440259,34.806793449227754,0.12,0.8116776315789473,0.0,0.6093477221257096,0.2938220013667163,0.7423177361488342,0.12121212121212122,0.14616934242574245,27.090023326222866,0.06,1.0,0.0,0.542031292985012,0.26380970856038666
gastroenterology,pancreatic disease,Is aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation beneficial in acute pancreatitis? A meta-analysis of randomized control trials and cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND:
There is conflincting evidence on the intravenous fluid (IVF) strategy for acute pancreatitis (AP). We perform a metaanalysis of the available evidence.

AIM:
To investigate if aggressive IVF therapy in AP patients is beneficial to decrease mortality and improve outcomes.

METHODS:
Metaanalysis of available randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing aggressive IVF <i>vs</i> non-aggressive IVF resuscitation.

RESULTS:
There was no significant difference in mortality between the aggressive (<i>n</i> = 1229) and non-aggressive IVF (<i>n</i> = 1397) patients. Patients receiving aggressive IVF therapy had higher risk for acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There also was no significant difference in the overall incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, persistent organ failure, pancreatic necrosis when comparing both study groups.

CONCLUSION:
Early aggressive IVF therapy did not improve mortality. Moreover, aggressive IVF therapy could potentially increase the risk for acute kidney injury and pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Studies are needed to investigate which subset of AP patients could benefit from aggressive IVF therapy.",There is conflincting evidence on the intravenous fluid (IVF) strategy for acute pancreatitis (AP).

"," The evidence regarding the benefits of aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis is mixed and of varying quality. A systematic review by Haydock et al.

However, a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial by Elmunzer [9] found that aggressive fluid resuscitation was more effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis than no treatment. A retrospective study by Gardner et al. [11] found that patients who received less than one third of their cumulative 72-hour intravenous fluid volume within the first 24 hours had higher mortality rates compared to those who were resuscitated more aggressively. A retrospective cohort study by Peery et al. [12] found that compared to nonaggressive fluid resuscitation, moderate and aggressive resuscitation was associated with lower rates of local complications, interventions and shorter hospital stays. A retrospective study on pediatric patients by Szabo et al. [13] found that aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation within 24 hours was associated with improved outcomes.

This implies that aggressive fluid resuscitation may not be beneficial in acute pancreatitis and motivating factors such as patient-specific variables and other comorbidities should be taken into consideration.,0.7652811408042908,0.15483870967741936,0.21397194147473994,33.61737702834199,0.07754010695187166,0.7441860465116279,0.0,0.5423110282542755,0.27588934415230537,0.7642087340354919,0.10738255033557048,0.15441176470588236,34.276860071730376,0.05080213903743316,0.7723514211886305,0.0,0.533037292736548,0.27251134832029816,0.7569271922111511,0.12389380530973451,0.10646778338362882,21.88266103981249,0.048330404217926184,1.0,0.0,0.4768124170258116,0.2751593735151418,0.7590978741645813,0.11960132890365448,0.11972240079772657,24.671415868137885,0.05463917525773196,1.0,0.0,0.482976635281421,0.27726928401710604,0.7618006467819214,0.11290322580645161,0.16018306636155608,30.553013553388,0.026737967914438502,0.7395348837209302,0.0,0.5167889663328727,0.2551597381966927,0.7803363800048828,0.1166180758017493,0.12647883317794667,22.828088405747195,0.05565529622980251,1.0,0.0,0.5189600189675146,0.289559810544047,0.7848260998725891,0.12857142857142856,0.16783225562311854,28.347489016589854,0.07194244604316546,1.0,0.0,0.536490532415589,0.2956795410284014,0.7781938314437866,0.12080536912751677,0.1741654571843251,34.393318412162444,0.0481283422459893,0.7677002583979329,0.0,0.5325989793790015,0.2712307809693184,0.7928504943847656,0.18766756032171583,0.12250731755699525,23.236532388508373,0.07923930269413629,1.0,0.0,0.5325068703205912,0.29963282874673636,0.7971230149269104,0.20987654320987656,0.16241814809633145,27.20409195003921,0.09596928982725528,1.0,0.0,0.5434397480872244,0.30396213698158303,0.7835930585861206,0.14814814814814814,0.2075812274368231,36.25061136892723,0.058823529411764705,0.7829507783449927,0.0,0.5565337064813395,0.27762483705597524,0.8355883955955505,0.2564102564102564,0.3003098282244424,42.979196471397586,0.22347266881028938,1.0,0.0,0.6007693810437722,0.33178630627508787,0.7569100856781006,0.13186813186813187,0.16061659381573368,31.234386088011888,0.048223350253807105,0.8527131782945736,0.0,0.4883717831168602,0.26501879956806235
medical genetics,genetic inheritance patterns,Does Childhood Trauma Moderate Polygenic Risk for Depression? A Meta-analysis of 5765 Subjects From the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.,"BACKGROUND:
The heterogeneity of genetic effects on major depressive disorder (MDD) may be partly attributable to moderation of genetic effects by environment, such as exposure to childhood trauma (CT). Indeed, previous findings in two independent cohorts showed evidence for interaction between polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and CT, albeit in opposing directions. This study aims to meta-analyze MDD-PRSÂ Ã CT interaction results across these two and other cohorts, while applying more accurate PRSs based on a larger discovery sample.

METHODS:
Data were combined from 3024 MDD cases and 2741 control subjects from nine cohorts contributing to the MDD Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. MDD-PRS were based on a discovery sample of â¼110,000 independent individuals. CT was assessed as exposure to sexual or physical abuse during childhood. In a subset of 1957 cases and 2002 control subjects, a more detailed five-domain measure additionally included emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect.

RESULTS:
MDD was associated with the MDD-PRS (odds ratio [OR]Â = 1.24, pÂ = 3.6Â Ã 10<sup>-5</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>Â = 1.18%) and with CT (ORÂ = 2.63, pÂ = 3.5Â Ã 10<sup>-18</sup> and ORÂ = 2.62, pÂ = 1.4Â Ã10<sup>-5</sup> for the two- and five-domain measures, respectively). No interaction was found between MDD-PRS and the two-domain and five-domain CT measure (ORÂ = 1.00, pÂ = .89 and ORÂ = 1.05, pÂ = .66).

CONCLUSIONS:
No meta-analytic evidence for interaction between MDD-PRS and CT was found. This suggests that the previously reported interaction effects, although both statistically significant, can best be interpreted as chance findings. Further research is required, but this study suggests that the genetic heterogeneity of MDD is not attributable to genome-wide moderation of genetic effects by CT.","The heterogeneity of genetic effects on major depressive disorder (MDD) may be partly attributable to moderation of genetic effects by environment, such as exposure to childhood trauma (CT).

TL;DR: While evidence suggests that childhood trauma and polygenic risk both independently contribute to the risk of depression, the interaction between the two is complex and may vary based on the severity of the trauma and specific genetic factors.

","A recent meta-analysis showed that heritability is a major risk factor for mental health conditions, including depression, between ages 13 and 35. Moreover, childhood trauma, stressful life changes, and certain personality traits (like obsessive-compulsive disorder) have been associated with an increased risk for developing depressive disorders. Additionally, research has shown that certain genetic markers such as the FKBP5 gene variants - rs1360780, rs3800373, and rs4713916 - may increase the predisposition for depression and suicidality. While genetic susceptibility is generally less likely in the elderly, some genetic markers such as E4 allele of apolipoprotein E and C677T mutation in MTHFR have been found to be associated with late-onset depression. Thus, evidence suggests that childhood trauma may moderate polygenic risk for depression.",0.7451754808425903,0.13114754098360656,0.15728620225557566,24.6442033258186,0.05660377358490566,1.0,0.0,0.5154874840203454,0.2440925624364504,0.7297925353050232,0.0925925925925926,0.12135645102339182,29.02494310387579,0.0546218487394958,0.9008909853249476,0.0,0.4964126627892256,0.23238492964206078,0.7819644808769226,0.1309090909090909,0.08757504248841502,15.246930988523658,0.056795131845841784,1.0,0.0,0.5290244811415251,0.2884335818931287,0.7916396856307983,0.1592920353982301,0.10867184990305961,18.27330417059633,0.07142857142857142,1.0,0.0,0.5462209823898282,0.29379779091909036,0.7656221389770508,0.1616161616161616,0.2083641975308642,35.50718636374277,0.0979381443298969,0.9360587002096437,0.0,0.5390572711533191,0.252224348967338,0.7484949231147766,0.09195402298850575,0.05849862085227491,11.522552841670636,0.029839883551673944,1.0,0.0,0.4758771864178869,0.2665427953117333,0.7475055456161499,0.10526315789473684,0.06637709645607476,13.072009468875903,0.03321976149914821,1.0,0.0,0.47480216640092077,0.2652056172922321,0.7810156345367432,0.1914893617021277,0.2136529053812194,37.25540807551729,0.0979381443298969,0.7234800838574423,0.0,0.5710267969902526,0.2600034843193406,0.7581570744514465,0.12121212121212122,0.0720141597051358,14.459529191856682,0.0343811394891945,1.0,0.0,0.4916634610854089,0.2696871586852246,0.7666195631027222,0.14883720930232558,0.09748690016547157,18.097353595784107,0.042821158690176324,1.0,0.0,0.5087778507731855,0.2752378099454954,0.7686117887496948,0.12121212121212122,0.20112374279040943,33.53142067515502,0.07425742574257425,0.8462264150943397,0.0,0.5227198843228615,0.2512309954779591,0.7720688581466675,0.15544041450777202,0.10473345950634809,18.560755207576015,0.06688963210702341,1.0,0.0,0.5403101300492006,0.2721512495867076,0.7543562650680542,0.1271676300578035,0.13654340232672268,19.763954732359252,0.05350553505535055,1.0,0.0,0.48828904170502896,0.2567594037596322
medical genetics,genetic risk assessment,Is birthweight associated with total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer risks? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It has been hypothesised that intrauterine exposures are important for subsequent prostate cancer risk. Prior epidemiological studies have used birthweight as a proxy of cumulative intrauterine exposures to test this hypothesis, but results have been inconsistent partly because of limited statistical power.

METHODS:
We investigated birthweight in relation to prostate cancer in the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) using Cox proportional hazards models. We then conducted a meta-analysis of birthweight in relation to total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer risks, combining results from the NSHD analysis with 13 additional studies on this relationship identified from a systematic search in four major scientific literature databases through January 2015.

RESULTS:
Random-effects models found that per kg increase in birthweight was positively associated with total (OR=1.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.00, 1.05; I(2)=13%) and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer (OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.99, 1.19; I(2)=40%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with birthweight extracted from medical records demonstrated stronger positive associations with total (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03, 1.19; I(2)=0%) and aggressive/lethal (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.09, 1.74; I(2)=0%) prostate cancer. These studies heavily overlapped with those based in Nordic countries.

CONCLUSIONS:
This study provides evidence that heavier birthweight may be associated with modest increased risks of total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer, which supports the hypothesis that intrauterine exposures may be related to subsequent prostate cancer risks.","It has been hypothesised that intrauterine exposures are important for subsequent prostate cancer risk.

There is dilemma as to whether patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requiring implant orthopaedic surgery are at an increased risk for post-operative surgical site infection (SSI). We conducted a systematic review to determine the effect of HIV on the risk of post-operative SSI and sought to determine if this risk is altered by antibiotic use beyond 24 hours.

METHODS:
We searched electronic databases, manually searched citations from relevant articles, and reviewed conference proceedings. The risk of postoperative SSI was pooled using Mantel-Haenszel method.

RESULTS:
We identified 18 cohort studies with 16 mainly small studies, addressing the subject. The pooled risk ratio of infection in the HIV patients when compared to non-HIV patients was 1.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.3-2.4), in studies in Africa this was 2.3 (95% CI 1.5-3.5). In a sensitivity analysis the risk ratio was reduced to 1.4 (95% CI 0.5-3.8). The risk ratio of infection in patients receiving prolonged antibiotics compared to patients receiving antibiotics for up to 24 hours was 0.7 (95% CI 0.1-4.2).

CONCLUSIONS:
The results may indicate an increased risk in HIV infected patients but these results are not robust and inconclusive after conducting the sensitivity analysis removing poor quality studies. There is need for larger good quality studies to provide conclusive evidence. To better develop surgical protocols, further studies should determine the effect of reduced CD4 counts, viral load suppression and prolonged antibiotics on the risk for infection.",There is dilemma as to whether patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requiring implant orthopaedic surgery are at an increased risk for post-operative surgical site infection (SSI).

Risk factors for infection in the general population are immunodepression and previous knee infection, while additional risk factors for haemophilic patients include insufficient haemostasis, HIV-positive status, and central venous catheters (CVCs). In HIV-positive patients with a low CD4 count, early treatment for suspected infection and individualized surgical intervention should be considered. Preventive measures such as preoperative screening, nasal decontamination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and laminar flow in operating theatres can help lower infection rates. The review does not provide specific details on study design, sample size, or potential risks of bias in the included studies.

TL;DR: The evidence suggests that there is an increased risk of postoperative infection in HIV-positive patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, particularly if they have a low CD4 count [1].

Lastly, a systematic review found strong evidence that HIV/AIDS is a factor that increases the risk of SSI after orthopaedic surgery [18].

TL;DR: The evidence suggests that HIV-positive patients may have an increased risk of surgical site infection after orthopaedic surgery, although this risk may be influenced by factors such as CD4 count, HIV clinical category, and overall health status.

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the nervous system,When does postural instability appear in monogenic parkinsonisms? An individual-patient meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Postural instability is a disease milestone signaling advanced disease.

OBJECTIVES:
To estimate the onset of postural instability in monogenic parkinsonisms.

METHODS:
We systematically reviewed studies (PubMed 1996-2017) in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, ATP13A2, FBXO7, VPS35, DNAJC6, or SYNJ1-related monogenic parkinsonisms, with documented postural instability. Genes withââ¥â15 patients were included in an individual-patient meta-analysis and compared with a retrospectively collected sporadic Parkinson's disease cohort from our center. The primary outcome measure was the progression-free survival from postural instability using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazards analyses were summarized using hazards ratio (HR).

RESULTS:
Of 2085 eligible studies, 124 met full criteria (636 patients) for the systematic review, whereas a total of 871 subjects (270 from sporadic cohort, 601 monogenic parkinsonisms) were included in the individual-patient meta-analysis. Postural instability was reported in 80% of DJ-1, 40% of PRKN, 39% of PINK1, 34% of ATP13A2, 31% of LRRK2, and 29% of SNCA patients. Progression-free survival from postural instability at 10Â years after disease onset was longest in ATP13A2 (97%) and shortest in SNCA (50%). Halfway between these two extremes were PRKN (88%), PINK1 (87%), and LRRK2 (81%), similar to sporadic Parkinson's disease (72%). Higher risk of postural instability was observed in SNCA (HRâ=â3.2, pâ=â0.007) and DJ-1 (HRâ=â3.96, pâ=â0.001) compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. Young age at onset in PINK1 and female sex in LRRK2 were associated with a decreased risk of postural instability.

Monogenic parkinsonisms exhibit differential timelines to postural instability, informing prognostic counseling and interpretation of future genotype-specific treatment trials.",To estimate the onset of postural instability in monogenic parkinsonisms.,"We systematically reviewed studies (PubMed 1996-2017) in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, ATP13A2, FBXO7, VPS35, DNAJC6, or SYNJ1-related monogenic parkinsonisms, with documented postural instability.

Monogenic parkinsonisms exhibit differential timelines to postural instability, informing prognostic counseling and interpretation of future genotype-specific treatment trials."," A case report involving a Kurdish family with FBXO7 mutations, a monogenic cause of early-onset parkinsonism, indicated the presence of postural instability in the index case and his sister [1]. The index case initially presented with speech problems, apathy, chorea, and tics, and later developed mild parkinsonism and postural instability. His sister, on the other hand, exhibited young-onset tremor-dominant parkinsonism with atypical features, including early development of postural instability. However, due to the nature of the study, the findings are limited in their generalizability, and potential biases may exist due to the lack of a control group and the small sample size [1].

TL;DR: Postural instability in monogenic parkinsonism, specifically with FBXO7 mutations, can appear early in the disease progression, but the evidence is based on a single family case report and may not be generalizable [1].

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the nervous system,Are there shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD? A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Dyslexia and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (estimates of 25-40% bidirectional comorbidity). Previous work has identified strong genetic and cognitive overlap between the disorders, but neural overlap is relatively unexplored. This study is a systematic meta-analysis of existing voxel-based morphometry studies to determine whether there is any overlap in the gray matter correlates of both disorders.

METHODS:
We conducted anatomic likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry studies in which individuals with dyslexia (15 studies; 417 cases, 416 controls) or ADHD (22 studies; 898 cases, 763 controls) were compared to typically developing controls. We generated ALE maps for dyslexia vs. controls and ADHD vs. controls using more conservative (pâ<â.001, kâ=â50) and more lenient (pâ<â.005, kâ=â50) thresholds. To determine the overlap of gray matter correlates of dyslexia and ADHD, we examined the statistical conjunction between the ALE maps for dyslexia vs. controls and ADHD vs. controls (false discovery rate [FDR] pâ<â.05, kâ=â50, 5000 permutations).

RESULTS:
Results showed largely distinct gray matter differences associated with dyslexia and ADHD. There was no evidence of statistically significant gray matter overlap at our conservative threshold, and only one region of overlap in the right caudate at our more lenient threshold. Reduced gray matter in the right caudate may be relevant to shared cognitive correlates in executive functioning and/or procedural learning. The more general finding of largely distinct regional differences in gray matter between dyslexia and ADHD suggests that other neuroimaging modalities may be more sensitive to overlapping neural correlates, and that current neuroimaging recruitment approaches may be hindering progress toward uncovering neural systems associated with comorbidity.

CONCLUSIONS:
The current study is the first to meta-analyze overlap between gray matter differences in dyslexia and ADHD, which is a critical step toward constructing a multi-level understanding of this comorbidity that spans the genetic, neural, and cognitive levels of analysis.","Dyslexia and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (estimates of 25-40% bidirectional comorbidity).

There was no evidence of statistically significant gray matter overlap at our conservative threshold, and only one region of overlap in the right caudate at our more lenient threshold. Reduced gray matter in the right caudate may be relevant to shared cognitive correlates in executive functioning and/or procedural learning. The more general finding of largely distinct regional differences in gray matter between dyslexia and ADHD suggests that other neuroimaging modalities may be more sensitive to overlapping neural correlates, and that current neuroimaging recruitment approaches may be hindering progress toward uncovering neural systems associated with comorbidity.
"," The evidence provided suggests potential shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD. The review by Shaywitz and Shaywitz [1] discusses the role of attentional mechanisms in reading difficulties and the potential effectiveness of ADHD treatments in improving reading in dyslexic students. Similarly, Frank and Pavlakis [2] highlight trends in neuroimaging studies of dyslexia and ADHD, with dyslexia often linked to deficits in phonologic processing and ADHD associated with abnormalities in prefrontal and striatal regions. A study by Mohl et al. [5] found that children with ADHD and Reading Disability (RD) demonstrated hypoactivation of left hemispheric, reading-related areas compared to typically developing controls. Mascheretti et al. [6] conducted a genome-wide association study that revealed significant genetic overlaps between some DD-related traits and ADHD.

Both conditions have been associated with abnormalities in the structure and functioning of the frontal lobe, particularly in areas involved in executive functions, attention, and impulse control. Additionally, both conditions have been linked to irregularities in the cerebellum, which plays a role in motor control and cognitive functions. However, the exact nature and extent of these shared neural correlates are still a subject of ongoing research.","Yes, there are shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD. Neuroimaging studies have shown that both conditions involve abnormalities in brain regions related to attention, working memory, and executive functions. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum are commonly implicated in both dyslexia and ADHD. Additionally, both conditions have been associated with reduced activation and connectivity in the left hemisphere language network, which is involved in reading and language processing. However, it is important to note that dyslexia and ADHD are distinct disorders with unique features and diagnostic criteria.","The papers suggest that there are largely distinct neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD. McGrath 2019 conducted a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies and found no statistically significant gray matter overlap between dyslexia and ADHD. Heim 2004 found large-scale neural alterations in the perisylvian region in dyslexia, while Raberger 2003 found that poor performance on continuous rapid naming tasks was associated with dyslexia and not ADHD. Gilger 1992 conducted a twin study and found that RD and ADHD may be primarily genetically independent, but trends in the data suggest that a genetically mediated comorbid subtype may exist. Overall, the papers suggest that while there may be some shared genetic etiology between dyslexia and ADHD, their neural correlates are largely distinct."," The evidence provided suggests potential shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD. The review by Shaywitz and Shaywitz [1] discusses the role of attentional mechanisms in reading difficulties and the potential effectiveness of ADHD treatments in improving reading in dyslexic students. Similarly, Frank and Pavlakis [2] highlight trends in neuroimaging studies of dyslexia and ADHD, with dyslexia often linked to deficits in phonologic processing and ADHD associated with abnormalities in prefrontal and striatal regions. A study by Mohl et al. [5] found that children with ADHD and Reading Disability (RD) demonstrated hypoactivation of left hemispheric, reading-related areas compared to typically developing controls. Mascheretti et al. [6] conducted a genome-wide association study that revealed significant genetic overlaps between some DD-related traits and ADHD.

","Studies have demonstrated shared neural correlates between dyslexia (the most common learning disability which accounts for 80% of such disorders) and ADHD. This is evidenced by an array of imaging studies (fMRI) showing hypoactivity in the left hemisphere of dyslexic patients, as well as reductions in activity in areas such as the anterior cingulate gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) in ADHD. Further, areas such as the frontostriatal regions feature a decrease in activity for individuals with either disorder. Besides shared neural correlates, both conditions have been associated with risk factors such as poverty, premature delivery, prenatal alcohol exposure, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, comorbid disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are common in both ADHD and dyslexia.",0.8083497285842896,0.1414141414141414,0.2255740885938143,41.79671646126426,0.11233480176211454,0.7839332460732984,0.0,0.64196297315162,0.30979321131276333,0.796826958656311,0.16304347826086957,0.23817812141291866,40.45071186532007,0.10792951541850221,0.7691803070402548,0.0,0.6331583337516201,0.3007964133949507,0.7823105454444885,0.13380281690140847,0.14226483043706087,31.73435649615174,0.07605985037406483,1.0,0.0,0.5677864363232812,0.2964415117445218,0.7787635326385498,0.13793103448275862,0.1508825060064508,33.80654891622123,0.08213256484149856,1.0,0.0,0.5624470140270609,0.29369603590912713,0.7911461591720581,0.15503875968992248,0.26235650510204084,32.09340686912299,0.04405286343612335,0.8350785340314136,0.0,0.6955652863814913,0.2968241963907386,0.7887464761734009,0.15602836879432627,0.16415218658812347,31.499960665305082,0.07263922518159806,1.0,0.0,0.5915477901697159,0.3014516392671008,0.7847228050231934,0.14671814671814673,0.16935922775056575,33.463473368184914,0.0766016713091922,1.0,0.0,0.5873224929106974,0.29790645152897177,0.7982010841369629,0.15503875968992248,0.39453125,33.62909030312922,0.046255506607929514,0.8465830807384954,0.0,0.6946248936242071,0.2960738514842181,0.7852532267570496,0.1761006289308176,0.18122309121654614,31.522816811157462,0.09072164948453608,1.0,0.0,0.5702066588582415,0.3014601430754988,0.7828249335289001,0.16901408450704225,0.17700434523302372,34.526448946633515,0.10196560196560196,1.0,0.0,0.5676494468137088,0.2994343458432664,0.7952834963798523,0.14285714285714285,0.3859115241241631,36.637564197211596,0.05947136563876652,0.806282722513089,0.0,0.6639106855159853,0.29596738231549646,0.8273255228996277,0.21645021645021645,0.28452528029873764,41.93293835272235,0.1607843137254902,0.7922171748280464,0.0,0.6511923949095024,0.32372793938811867,0.7763838768005371,0.12987012987012989,0.15963416924955384,34.87526609426092,0.0812720848056537,0.9569808027923211,0.0,0.5529464328900362,0.28655083959733607
