allergy and immunology,asthma,Are prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms associated with asthma or atopic diseases throughout the offspring's childhood? An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age. Studies suggested that these conditions might be related to prenatal depression or anxiety. This study aimed to explore the association between prenatal mental disorders and childhood asthma or atopic disease in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, and theÂ Cochrane Library were searched up to May 2020. The primary outcome was childhood asthma and childhood atopic dermatitis. Random-effects models were used because of high heterogeneity indicated by I<sup>2</sup>â>â50% and Q-test Pâ<â0.10.

RESULTS:
A total of 598 studies were initially identified, but nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Prenatal mental disorder was associated with childhood asthma (nâ=â6 studies; ESâ=â1.146, 95%CI: 1.054-1.245, Pâ=â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â93.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001) whereas no significant association was found for childhood atopic dermatitis (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.211, 95%CI: 0.982-1.494, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â78.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001). Childhood asthma seems to be related more to depression (nâ=â1 study; ESâ=â1.170, 95%CI: 1.061-1.291, Pâ=â0.002) and anxiety/depression (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.157, 95%CI: 1.050-1.275, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â95.3%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001).

CONCLUSION:
This meta-analysis demonstrated that prenatal mental disorders increase the risk of childhood asthma. We limited the included samples to pregnant women to investigate the association between prenatal psychological factors and offspring's physical health. Future studies should include large high-quality cohort studies to investigate the behavioral, environmental, and genetic causes for this association.","Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Should we care about Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection? A systematic review and a cases series from the Brazilian Amazon.,"BACKGROUND:
Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues. However, evidence on HIV-Plasmodium vivax co-infection (HIV/PvCo) is scarce, with most of the available information related to Plasmodium falciparum on the African continent. It is unclear whether HIV can change the clinical course of vivax malaria and increase the risk of complications. In this study, a systematic review of HIV/PvCo studies was performed, and recent cases from the Brazilian Amazon were included.

METHODS:
Medical records from a tertiary care centre in the Western Brazilian Amazon (2009-2018) were reviewed to identify HIV/PvCo hospitalized patients. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes are reported. Also, a systematic review of published studies on HIV/PvCo was conducted. Metadata, number of HIV/PvCo cases, demographic, clinical, and outcome data were extracted.

RESULTS:
A total of 1,048 vivax malaria patients were hospitalized in the 10-year period; 21 (2.0%) were HIV/PvCo cases, of which 9 (42.9%) had AIDS-defining illnesses. This was the first malaria episode in 11 (52.4%) patients. Seven (33.3%) patients were unaware of their HIV status and were diagnosed on hospitalization. Severe malaria was diagnosed in 5 (23.8%) patients. One patient died. The systematic review search provided 17 articles (12 cross-sectional or longitudinal studies and 5 case report studies). A higher prevalence of studies involved cases in African and Asian countries (35.3 and 29.4%, respectively), and the prevalence of reported co-infections ranged from 0.1 to 60%.

CONCLUSION:
Reports of HIV/PvCo are scarce in the literature, with only a few studies describing clinical and laboratory outcomes. Systematic screening for both co-infections is not routinely performed, and therefore the real prevalence of HIV/PvCo is unknown. This study showed a low prevalence of HIV/PvCo despite the high prevalence of malaria and HIV locally. Even though relatively small, this is the largest case series to describe HIV/PvCo.","Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Bladder Cancer in HIV-infected Adults: An Emerging Issue? Case-Reports and Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES:
Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Albeit bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, it has been rarely reported among HIV-infected patients. We wished to assess the prevalence and characteristics of bladder cancer in HIV-infected patients.

METHODS:
We conducted a single center retrospective study from 1998 to 2013 in a university hospital in Paris. Cases of bladder cancer among HIV-infected patients were identified using the electronic records of the hospital database and of the HIV-infected cohort. Patient characteristics and outcomes were retrieved from patients charts. A systematic review of published cases of bladder cancers in patients with HIV-infection was also performed.

RESULTS:
During the study period we identified 15 HIV-infected patients (0.2% of the cohort) with a bladder cancer. Patients were mostly men (73%) and smokers (67%), with a median age of 56 years at cancer diagnosis. Bladder cancer was diagnosed a median of 14 years after HIV-infection. Most patients were on ART (86%) with median current and nadir CD4 cell counts of 506 and 195 cells/mm3, respectively. Haematuria (73%) was the most frequent presenting symptom and HPV-associated lesions were seen in 6/10 (60%) patients. Histopathology showed transitional cell carcinoma in 80% and a high proportion of tumors with muscle invasion (47%) and high histologic grade (73%). One-year survival rate was 74.6%. The systematic review identified 13 additional cases of urothelial bladder cancers which shared similar features.

CONCLUSIONS:
Bladder cancers in HIV-infected patients remain rare but may occur in relatively young patients with a low nadir CD4 cell count, have aggressive pathological features and can be fatal.","Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Is having sex with other men a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections in male blood donors in Western countries? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.

METHODS:
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.

RESULTS:
Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.

CONCLUSIONS:
High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.","Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.","We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.","Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included.

allergy and immunology,pediatric allergy,"Atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, or eczema? A systematic review, meta-analysis, and recommendation for uniform use of 'atopic dermatitis'.","BACKGROUND:
The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. It also negatively impacts accurate communication of research in the scientific literature. We sought to determine the most commonly used terms for AD.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (1945-2016) for the terms AD, atopic eczema (AE), and multiple other eczematous disorders.

RESULTS:
In MEDLINE, 33 060 were identified, of which 21 299 (64.4%) publications used the term 'AD', 15 510 (46.9%) 'eczema', and only 2471 (7.5%) AE. Most of these publications used the term AD (82.0%) or eczema (70.8%) without additional nomenclature; only 1.2% used AE alone. Few publications used the terminology 'childhood eczema', 'flexural eczema', 'infantile eczema', 'atopic neurodermatitis', or 'Besnier's prurigo'. AD was rarely used until the late 1970s, after which it became the most commonly used of the three terms and continuously increased until 2015. Atopic eczema decreased between 2008 and 2015. Atopic dermatitis was the most commonly used term in studies across almost all publication types, languages, and journals.

CONCLUSION:
Atopic dermatitis is the most commonly used term and appears to be increasing in popularity. Given that eczema is a nonspecific term that describes the morphological appearance of several forms of dermatitis, we strongly suggest the use of a more specific term, AD, in publications, healthcare clinician training, and patient education. Support from researchers, reviewers, and editors is key to success.","The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers.

allergy and immunology,pediatric allergy,Treating asthma with omega-3 fatty acids: where is the evidence? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids. Given the interplay between pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, and the less pro-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, it has been thought that the latter could play a key role in treating or preventing asthma. The purpose was to systematically review the scientific-medical literature in order to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence for possible treatment effects of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma.

METHODS:
Medline, Premedline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Health, and, Dissertation Abstracts were searched to April 2003. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT's) of subjects of any age that used any foods or extracts containing omega-3 fatty acids as treatment or prevention for asthma. Data included all asthma related outcomes, potential covariates, characteristics of the study, design, population, intervention/exposure, comparators, and co interventions.

RESULTS:
Ten RCT's were found pertinent to the present report.

CONCLUSION:
Given the largely inconsistent picture within and across respiratory outcomes, it is impossible to determine whether or not omega-3 fatty acids are an efficacious adjuvant or monotherapy for children or adults. Based on this systematic review we recommend a large randomized controlled study of the effects of high-dose encapsulated omega-3 fatty acids on ventilatory and inflammatory measures of asthma controlling diet and other asthma risk factors. This review was limited because Meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to missing data; poorly or heterogeneously defined populations, interventions, intervention-comparator combinations, and outcomes. In addition, small sample sizes made it impossible to meaningfully assess the impact on clinical outcomes of co-variables. Last, few significant effects were found.","Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids.

allergy and immunology,rhinitis and sinusitis,"Taste receptors in chronic rhinosinusitus, what is the evidence? A systematic review.","BACKGROUND:
Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Growing evidence suggests extraoral TRs as relevant biomarkers, but the current understanding is incomplete. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence of extraoral taste receptors in CRS.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus were reviewed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included studies of genotypic and phenotypic T2R/T1R status in CRS patients.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two studies with 3845 patients were included. Seventeen studies evaluated genotype and 10 evaluated taste phenotypes. Four of 6 studies examining the haplotype distribution of the T2R, TAS2R38, demonstrated increased AVI/AVI haplotype (""nontaster"") frequency in CRS. Meanwhile, 2 studies demonstrated decreased bitter sensitivity in CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), whereas 3 other studies reported decreased bitter sensitivity only in CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). Findings regarding sweet sensitivity were mixed. Three studies with cystic fibrosis patients (nÂ =Â 1393) were included. Studies investigating the association between clinical outcomes and TAS2R38 alleles were limited, but the nonfunctional combination of AVI/AVI was associated with increased utilization of sinus surgery and, in CRSsNP patients, with poorer improvement of symptoms postoperatively.

CONCLUSION:
Both genotypic and phenotypic assessments of T2Rs suggest a potential association with CRS, particularly CRSsNP. However, limited evidence and mixed conclusions cloud the role of T2Rs in CRS. Future investigations should aim to increase diverse populations, broaden institutional diversity, examine T1Rs, and utilize uniform assessments.","Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

anesthesiology,pediatric anesthesia,Is thoracoscopy superior to thoracotomy in the treatment of congenital lung malformations? An updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A meta-analysis was performed for a comparison of outcomes between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy for congenital lung malformations (CLM).

METHODS:
Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically for literature aimed mainly at reporting the therapeutic effects for CLM administrated by VATS and thoracotomy.

RESULTS:
A total of 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, involving 2896 subjects. VATS was associated with fewer complications [odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.69], less use of epidural anesthesia (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.23), shorter length of hospital stay [standard mean difference (SMD) -0.98; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.55] and chest drainage (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.17), as compared with thoracotomy. However, thoracotomy showed superiority in reduced operative time (SMD, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.04-0.84).

anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is Femoral Nerve Block Superior to Fascia Iliac Block in Hip Surgery? Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of FNB compared with FICB are yet to be fully determined.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were systematically searched. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hip surgery were included. Postoperatively, the pain scores at different time points, narcotic requirements in 24âh, mean arterial pressure, spinal anesthesia (SA) time, patient satisfaction, and adverse effect rates between the two groups were extracted throughout the study.

RESULTS:
Fourteen RCTs including 1179 patients were included. Compared to the FICB, FNB decreased the VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and the incidence rate of some side effects (nausea, vomiting, and sedation) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, compared to the FICB, no significant difference was found in the FNB regarding the VAS scores postoperatively at any of the other time points (2âmin, 20âmin, 2âh, 24âh at movement, 48âh at rest, and 48âh at movement). Patients in both groups had similar narcotic needs after 24âh, mean arterial pressure, SA time, and patient satisfaction (<i>P</i> > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
FNB has more advantages in reducing VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest and the odds of some adverse effects. A better quality RCT is needed to properly compare FNB with FICB.","Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery.

anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is local anaesthesia a favourable approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation? A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing local and general anaesthesia.,"OBJECTIVES:
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the potential favourable effects of local anaesthesia plus sedation (LAS) compared with general anaesthesia (GA) in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

METHODS:
Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and the reference lists of eligible publications were screened for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies published between 1 January 2006 and 26 June 2016 that compare LAS to GA in an adult study population undergoing TAVI. We conducted study quality assessments using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and structured the review according to PRISMA. A meta-analysis calculating the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under the assumption of a random-effects model was performed. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the IÂ² statistic and Cochran's Q-test.

RESULTS:
After database screening, one RCT and 19 observational studies were included in the review. We found no differences between LAS and GA in terms of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and other endpoints that addressed safety and complication rates. LAS was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay and with lower rates of catecholamine administration and red blood cell transfusion. New pacemaker implantations occurred more frequently under LAS. The overall conversion rate from LAS to GA was 6.2%.

CONCLUSION:
For TAVI, both LAS and GA are feasible and safe. LAS may have some benefits such as increased haemodynamic stability and shorter hospital and ICU stays, but it does not impact 30-day mortality. Since there is a paucity of randomised trial data and the findings are mainly based on observational study data, this review should be considered as a hypothesis-generating article for subsequent RCTs that are required to confirm the potential favourable effects we detected for LAS.

anesthesiology,surgical critical care,How does the implementation of a patient pathway-based intervention in the acute care of blunt thoracic injury impact on patient outcomes? A systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Blunt thoracic injury is present in around 15% of all major trauma presentations. To ensure a standardised approach to the management of physical injury, patient pathway-based interventions have been established in many healthcare settings. It currently remains unclear how these complex interventions are implemented and evaluated in the literature. This systematic review aims to identify pathway effectiveness literature and implementation studies in relation to patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury care.

METHODS:
The databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, WHO Clinical Trials Register and both the GreyLit & OpenGrey databases were searched without restrictions on date or study type. A search strategy was developed including keywords and MeSH terms relating to blunt thoracic injury, patient pathway-based interventions, evaluation and implementation. Due to heterogeneity of intervention pathways, meta-analysis was not possible; analysis was undertaken using an iterative narrative approach.

RESULTS:
A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in analysis. Pathways were identified covering analgesic management, respiratory care, surgical decision making and reducing risk of complications. Studies evaluating pathways are generally limited by their observational and retrospective design, but results highlight the potential benefits of pathway driven care provision in blunt thoracic injury.

CONCLUSIONS:
The results demonstrate the complexity of evaluating patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury management. It is important that pathways undergo rigorous evaluation, refinement and validation to ensure quality and patient safety. Strong recommendations are precluded as the quality of the pathway evaluation studies are low.","Blunt thoracic injury is present in around 15% of all major trauma presentations.

anesthesiology,surgical critical care,Does Surgery Reduce the Risk of Complications Among Patients with Multiple Rib Fractures? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Multiple rib fractures are common in trauma patients, who are prone to trauma-associated complications. Surgical or nonsurgical interventions for the aforementioned conditions remain controversial.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
The purpose of our study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical prognosis of surgical fixation of multiple rib fractures in terms of (1) hospital-related endpoints (including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay [LOS] and hospital LOS), (2) complications, (3) pulmonary function, and (4) pain scores.

METHODS:
We screened PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomized and prospective studies published before January 2018. Individual effect sizes were standardized; the pooled effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Primary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and hospital LOS. Moreover, complications, pulmonary function, and pain were assessed.

RESULTS:
The surgical group had a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.95 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.97 to -1.94; p = 0.001), ICU LOS (WMD, -4.81 days; 95% CI, -6.22 to -3.39; p < 0.001), and hospital LOS (WMD, -8.26 days; 95% CI, -11.73 to -4.79; p < 0.001) compared with the nonsurgical group. Complications likewise were less common in the surgical group, including pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.64; p < 0.001), mortality (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.87; p = 0.030), chest wall deformity (OR, 0.02; 95% CI. 0.00-0.12; p < 0.001), dyspnea (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54; p < 0.001), chest wall tightness (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05-0.22; p < 0.001) and incidence of tracheostomy (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20-0.57; p < 0.001). There were no differences between the surgical and nonsurgical groups in terms of pulmonary function, such as forced vital capacity (WMD, 6.81%; 95% CI: -8.86 to 22.48; p = 0.390) and pain scores (WMD, -11.41; 95% CI: -42.09 to 19.26; p = 0.470).

CONCLUSIONS:
This meta-analysis lends stronger support to surgical fixation, rather than conservative treatment, for multiple rib fractures. Nevertheless, additional trials should be conducted to investigate surgical indications, timing, and followup for quality of life.

cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,Heart failure in pregnancy: what is the long-term impact of pregnancy on cardiac function? A tertiary care centre experience and systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Women with cardiomyopathy (CM) are often advised against pregnancy due to risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, the impact of CM subtype on maternal MACE is not understood, and so we sought to evaluate the influence of CM phenotype on maternal outcomes, as well as the effect on immediate and late left ventricular function.

METHODS:
We evaluated all pregnant women in our high-risk maternal cardiovascular programme (2009-2019). Composite maternal MACE included: death, inotrope use, left ventricular assist device, orthotopic heart transplant and/or escalation in transplant listing status, acute decompensated heart failure and sustained ventricular arrhythmia.

RESULTS:
Among 875 women followed, 32 had CM (29Â±7 years old, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 41%Â±12%): 3 ischaemic CM (ICM), 10 peripartum CM (PPCM) and 19 non-ICM (NICM). MACE events occurred in 6 (18%) women (PPCM: 2 (33%), NICM: 4 (67%)). There was no difference in LVEF at baseline, however, women with MACE had significantly lower LVEF both early (LVEF: 27Â±5% vs . 41Â±2%, p<0.05) and late post partum (LVEF: 28Â±5% vs . 44Â±2%, p<0.01).

CONCLUSIONS:
In this contemporary cohort of women with CM, maternal MACE rates were lower than previously reported, and were less common in PPCM as compared with ICM and NICM. Heart function in women with MACE was negatively impacted immediately after delivery and in late postpartum follow-up, suggesting that pregnancy itself likely has influence on future left ventricular function in women with underlying CM.","Women with cardiomyopathy (CM) are often advised against pregnancy due to risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,How safe and effective are flow diverters for the treatment of unruptured small/medium intracranial aneurysms of the internal carotid artery? Meta-analysis for evidence-based performance goals.,"BACKGROUND:
The objective of this meta-analysis was to establish safety and effectiveness benchmarks for endovascular therapy of unruptured small-to-medium internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms using flow diverters.

METHODS:
A systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis were performed using best research methods. Studies of any design with at least 10 patients treated with flow diverters for predominantly (â¥90%) unruptured small/medium ICA aneurysms and â¥6âmonth follow-up were included. The primary effectiveness endpoint was complete aneurysm occlusion rate at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was a composite measure of cumulative events that could indicate a stroke or neurologic death: any death, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or worsening on the modified Rankin Scale.

RESULTS:
41 studies (2614 patients) met eligibility criteria for the meta-analysis. The core lab adjusted complete occlusion rate was 74.9% (95% CI 69.6% to 79.8%) at 12 months for studies using any flow diverter. With an aim of generating performance goals for a US Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, a pre-specified analysis was conducted using only studies with flow diverters commercially available in the USA. In this cohort, 12âmonth complete occlusion was 74.6% (95% CI 66.8% to 81.7%). The primary safety event rate for flow diverters commercially available in the USA was 7.8% (95% CI 4.8% to 11.4%).

CONCLUSIONS:
The treatment of small and medium-sized aneurysms with flow diverters is effective in achieving curative reconstruction in most cases and is associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality. This meta-analysis informs robust performance goals for evaluating new flow diverters in small/medium unruptured carotid aneurysms.",The objective of this meta-analysis was to establish safety and effectiveness benchmarks for endovascular therapy of unruptured small-to-medium internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms using flow diverters.,"A systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis were performed using best research methods.

cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,How should long-term free-living physical activity be targeted after stroke? A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"BACKGROUND:
Increasing physical activity (PA) levels (regular movement such as walking and activities of daily living) and reducing time spent sedentary improves cardiovascular health and reduces morbidity and mortality. Fewer than 30% of independently mobile stroke survivors undertake recommended levels of PA. Sedentary behaviour is also high in this population. We aimed to systematically review the study characteristics and the promise of interventions targeting free-living PA and/or sedentary behaviour in adult stroke survivors.

METHODS:
Seven electronic databases were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (â¥3-months follow-up) targeting PA and/or sedentary behaviour in adults with first or recurrent stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The quality assessment framework for RCTs was used to assess risk of bias within and across studies. Interventions were rated as ""very"", ""quite"" or ""non-promising"" based on within- or between-group outcome differences. Intervention descriptions were captured using the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) Checklist. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within interventions were coded using the BCT Taxonomy v1, and compared between studies by calculating a promise ratio.

RESULTS:
Nine studies fulfilled the review criteria (Nâ=â717 randomised stroke patients) with a high or unclear risk of bias. None of the studies targeted sedentary behaviour. Six studies were very/quite promising (reported increases in PA post-intervention). Studies were heterogeneous in their reporting of participant age, time since stroke, stroke type, and stroke location. Sub-optimal intervention descriptions, treatment fidelity and a lack of standardisation of outcome measures were identified. Face to face and telephone-based self-management programmes were identified as having promise to engage stroke survivors in PA behaviour change. Optimal intensity of contact, interventionist type and time after stroke to deliver interventions was unclear. Nine promising BCTs (ratios â¥2) were identified: information about health consequences; information about social and environmental consequences; goal setting-behaviour; problem-solving; action planning; feedback on behaviour; biofeedback; social support unspecified; and credible source.

CONCLUSIONS:
Future research would benefit from establishing stroke survivor preferences for mode of delivery, setting and intensity, including measurement of physical activity.

cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,Are interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors effective? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. However, many individuals are unaware of their CVD risk factors. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of existing intervention strategies to increase uptake of CVD risk factors screening.

METHODS:
A systematic search was conducted through Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additional articles were located through cross-checking of the references list and bibliography citations of the included studies and previous review papers. We included intervention studies with controlled or baseline comparison groups that were conducted in primary care practices or the community, targeted at adult populations (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials with controlled groups and pre- and post-intervention studies). The interventions were targeted either at individuals, communities, health care professionals or the health-care system. The main outcome of interest was the relative risk (RR) of screening uptake rates due to the intervention.

RESULTS:
We included 21 studies in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias for randomization was low to medium in the randomized controlled trials, except for one, and high in the non-randomized trials. Two analyses were performed; optimistic (using the highest effect sizes) and pessimistic (using the lowest effect sizes). Overall, interventions were shown to increase the uptake of screening for CVD risk factors (RR 1.443; 95% CI 1.264 to 1.648 for pessimistic analysis and RR 1.680; 95% CI 1.420 to 1.988 for optimistic analysis). Effective interventions that increased screening participation included: use of physician reminders (RR ranged between 1.392; 95% CI 1.192 to 1.625, and 1.471; 95% CI 1.304 to 1.660), use of dedicated personnel (RR ranged between 1.510; 95% CI 1.014 to 2.247, and 2.536; 95% CI 1.297 to 4.960) and provision of financial incentives for screening (RR 1.462; 95% CI 1.068 to 2.000). Meta-regression analysis showed that the effect of CVD risk factors screening uptake was not associated with study design, types of population nor types of interventions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Interventions using physician reminders, using dedicated personnel to deliver screening, and provision of financial incentives were found to be effective in increasing CVD risk factors screening uptake.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally.

Overall, interventions were shown to increase the uptake of screening for CVD risk factors (RR 1.443; 95% CI 1.264 to 1.648 for pessimistic analysis and RR 1.680; 95% CI 1.420 to 1.988 for optimistic analysis). Effective interventions that increased screening participation included: use of physician reminders (RR ranged between 1.392; 95% CI 1.192 to 1.625, and 1.471; 95% CI 1.304 to 1.660), use of dedicated personnel (RR ranged between 1.510; 95% CI 1.014 to 2.247, and 2.536; 95% CI 1.297 to 4.960) and provision of financial incentives for screening (RR 1.462; 95% CI 1.068 to 2.000). Meta-regression analysis showed that the effect of CVD risk factors screening uptake was not associated with study design, types of population nor types of interventions.","Interventions using physician reminders, using dedicated personnel to deliver screening, and provision of financial incentives were found to be effective in increasing CVD risk factors screening uptake.",28095788,"['15652604', '18607383', '19896746', '24391296', '21379413', '21346920', '15364185', '19141562', '11004141', '17554120', '14993137', '19959603', '25445334', '20828583', '23169871', '23900533', '23878164', '24004991', '24004991', '23169868', '23318544', '23318544', '23318544', '20466791', '9552998', '23442805', '24252125', '10984843', '24690919', '24202056', '25267047', '21624394', '22345673', '21063634', '22132384', '16191138', '10718687', '11030000', '3605164', '3605164', '24609605', '24609605', '19961608', '12958120', '12111916', '2494397', '1985140', '18172036', '2495053', '16287768', '18755784', '3107700', '15325326', '14988972', '12890291', '24278438', '22681743', '8522084', '20353659', '18298863', '2022937', '17146487', '8563368', '11276541', '1289110', '9382404', '11992299', '17927463', '18474705', '22230833', '26510577', '11279781', '21563135', '23064024', '25326646']","['10.1016/S0140-6736(05)70151-3', '10.1038/ijo.2008.102', '10.1016/j.diabres.2009.10.007', '10.2471/BLT.13.121954', '10.2471/BLT.10.080820', '10.2471/BLT.10.079947', '10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9', '10.1093/eurheartj/ehn554', '10.1161/01.CIR.102.13.1511', '10.1056/NEJMsa053935', '10.1161/01.CIR.0000118498.35499.B2', '10.1093/ije/dyp330', '10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.11.007', '10.1016/j.ypmed.2010.08.017', '10.1136/bmj.e7775', '10.1136/bmj.f4788', '10.1136/bmj.f4675', '10.1136/bmj.f5227', '10.1136/bmj.f5227', '10.1136/bmj.e7191', '10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.3187', '10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.3187', '10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.3187', '10.1136/bmj.c2138', '10.1136/bmj.316.7139.1208', '10.1186/1471-2296-14-29', '10.1186/1471-2296-14-175', '10.1371/journal.pone.0091157', '10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003428', '10.3399/bjgp14X681781', '10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.05.005', '10.1177/2047487311433890', '10.1002/chp.1340180206', '10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.0197.x', '10.2105/AJPH.90.10.1622', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90507-9', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90507-9', '10.1136/bmj.g1687', '10.1136/bmj.g1687', '10.1186/1471-2288-9-80', '10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557', '10.1002/sim.1183', '10.1097/00005650-198903000-00008', '10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.697201', '10.1136/bmj.298.6671.433', '10.1001/archinte.165.20.2388', '10.1093/ageing/afn150', '10.1136/bmj.294.6579.1080', '10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.05.007', '10.1186/1472-6963-3-15', '10.1371/journal.pone.0081441', '10.1186/1471-2296-13-54', '10.3399/bjgp10X483904', '10.1186/1471-2458-8-73', '10.7326/0003-4819-127-9-199711010-00008', '10.7326/0003-4819-136-9-200205070-00006', '10.1370/afm.1312', '10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.10.007', '10.2196/jmir.3442']",Are interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors effective?,2/2/2018,Are interventions to increase the uptake of screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors effective?,"Overall, interventions were shown to increase the uptake of screening for CVD risk factors (RR 1.443; 95% CI 1.264 to 1.648 for pessimistic analysis and RR 1.680; 95% CI 1.420 to 1.988 for optimistic analysis).

cardiovascular medicine,cardiovascular medicine,A systematic review of PET and PET/CT in oncology: a way to personalize cancer treatment in a cost-effective manner?,"BACKGROUND:
A number of diagnostic tests are required for the detection and management of cancer. Most imaging modalities such as computerized tomography (CT) are anatomical. However, positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional diagnostic imaging technique using compounds labelled with positron-emitting radioisotopes to measure cell metabolism. It has been a useful tool in studying soft tissues such as the brain, cardiovascular system, and cancer. The aim of this systematic review is to critically summarize the health economic evidence of oncologic PET in the literature.

METHODS:
Eight electronic databases were searched from 2005 until February 2010 to identify economic evaluation studies not included in previous Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports. Only full health economic evaluations in English, French, or German were considered for inclusion. Economic evaluations were appraised using published quality criteria for assessing the quality of decision-analytic models. Given the variety of methods used in the health economic evaluations, the economic evidence has been summarized in qualitative form.

RESULTS:
From this new search, 14 publications were identified that met the inclusion criteria. All publications were decision-analytic models and evaluated PET using Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (FDG-PET). Eight publications were cost-effectiveness analyses; six were cost-utility analyses. The studies were from Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the base case analyses of these studies, cost-effectiveness results ranged from dominated to dominant. The methodology of the economic evaluations was of varying quality. Cost-effectiveness was primarily influenced by the cost of PET, the specificity of PET, and the risk of malignancy.

CONCLUSIONS:
Owing to improved care and less exposure to ineffective treatments, personalized medicine using PET may be cost-effective. However, the strongest evidence for the cost-effectiveness of PET is still in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Management decisions relating to the assessment of treatment response or radiotherapy treatment planning require further research to show the impact of PET on patient management and its cost-effectiveness. Because of the potential for increased patient throughput and the possible greater accuracy, the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT may be superior to that of PET. Only four studies of the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT were found in this review, and this is clearly an area for future research.","A number of diagnostic tests are required for the detection and management of cancer.

cardiovascular medicine,acute coronary syndromes,Could platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio be a predictor for contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with acute coronary syndrome?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is acute renal failure observed after administration of iodinated contrast media during angiographic or other medical procedures. In recent years, many studies have focused on biomarkers that recognize CIN and/or predict its development in advance. One of the many biomarkers studied is the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation between PLR level and CIN.

METHODS:
Relevant studies were searched in PUBMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science until September 15, 2018. Case-control studies reporting admission PLR levels in CIN and non-CIN group in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the association between PLR level and CIN using a random-effect model.

RESULTS:
Six relevant studies involving a total of 10452 ACS patients (9720 non-CIN controls and 732 CIN patients) met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of 6 case-control studies showed that PLR levels were significantly higher in CIN group than those in non-CIN group (WMDâ=â33.343, 95%CIâ=â18.863 to 47.823, P < .001, Iâ=â88.0%).

CONCLUSION:
For patients with ACS after contrast administration, our meta-analysis shows that on-admission PLR levels in CIN group are significantly higher than those of non-CIN group. However, large and matched cohort studies are needed to validate these findings and assess whether there is a real connection or just an association.","Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is acute renal failure observed after administration of iodinated contrast media during angiographic or other medical procedures.

cardiovascular medicine,acute coronary syndromes,Should dual antiplatelet therapy be used in patients following coronary artery bypass surgery? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND:
We assessed the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post elective or urgent (i.e., post acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

METHODS:
We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Registry from inception to August 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults undergoing CABG comparing either dual vs. single antiplatelet therapy or higher- vs. lower-intensity DAPT were identified.

RESULTS:
Nine RCTs (nâ=â4,887) with up to 1y follow-up were included. Five RCTs enrolled patients post-elective CABG (nâ=â986). Two multi-centre RCTs enrolled ACS patients who subsequently underwent CABG (nâ=â2,155). These 7 RCTs compared clopidogrel plus aspirin to aspirin alone. Two other multi-centre RCTs reported on ACS patients who subsequently underwent CABG comparing higher intensity DAPT with either ticagrelor (nâ=â1,261) or prasugrel (nâ=â485) plus aspirin to clopidogrel plus aspirin. Post-operative anti-platelet therapy was started when chest tube bleeding was no longer significant, typically within 24-48 h. There were no differences in all-cause mortality in clopidogrel plus aspirin vs. aspirin RCTs; conversely, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in ticagrelor and prasugrel vs. clopidogrel RCTs (risk ratio[RR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval[CI] 0.33-0.71, pâ=â0.0002; 2 RCTs, nâ=â1695; I(2) â=â0%; interaction pâ<â0.01 compared to clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin RCTs). There were no differences in myocardial infarctions, strokes, or composite outcomes. Overall, major bleeding was not significantly increased (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.81-2.10, pâ=â0.27; 7 RCTs, nâ=â4500). There was heterogeneity (I(2) â =â42%) due almost entirely to higher bleeding reported for the prasugrel RCT which included mainly CABG-related major bleeding (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.45-6.87, pâ=â0.004; 1 RCT, nâ=â437).

CONCLUSIONS:
Most RCT data for DAPT post CABG is derived from subgroups of ACS patients in DAPT RCTs requiring CABG who resume DAPT post-operatively. Limited RCT data with heterogeneous trial designs suggest that higher intensity (prasugrel or ticagrelor) but not lower intensity (clopidogrel) DAPT is associated with an approximate 50% lower mortality in ACS patients who underwent CABG based on post-randomization subsets from single RCTs. Large prospective RCTs evaluating the use of DAPT post-CABG are warranted to provide more definitive guidance for clinicians.","We assessed the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post elective or urgent (i.e., post acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).","We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Registry from inception to August 2015.

cardiovascular medicine,cardiac arrhythmias,Does Dexmedetomidine Reduce the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke After Adult Cardiac Surgery? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a common consequence of cardiac sur-gery with increased stroke complications and mortality. Although dexmedetomidine is thought to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation and stroke because of its sympa-tholytic and anti-inflammatory properties, data from different studies show the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative atrial fibrillation and stroke uncertain in adult patients with cardiac surgery.

METHODS:
A database including EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL was searched for randomized controlled trials comparing dexmedetomidine with placebo or other anesthetic drugs in adult cardiac surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of postop-erative stroke, mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, hospi-tal length of stay, and mortality.

RESULTS:
Eighteen trials with a total of 2933 patients were enrolled in the meta-analyses. Compared with controls, dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation [odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.98; P = .03]. There was no sig-nificant difference between groups in stroke (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.59-3.16; P = .47), mechanical ventilation duration [weighted mean difference, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.35 to 0.14;P=.39], intensive care unit length of stay (weighted mean difference, -0.03; 95% CI,-0.93 to 0.87; P = .95), hospital length of stay (weighted mean difference, -0.04; 95% CI,-0.40 to 0.32; P = .83) and mortality (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.60; P = .42).

CONCLUSION:
Perioperative dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Can acupuncture reverse oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage in animal models of vascular dementia?: A preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Vascular dementia is a cognitive dysfunction syndrome caused by cerebral vascular factors such as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The effect of acupuncture on vascular dementia models is ambiguous, and there is controversy about whether acupuncture has a placebo effect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the most essential mechanisms in preclinical studies of vascular dementia. However, there is no meta-analysis on the mechanism of vascular dementia in animal models. It is necessary to explore the efficacy of acupuncture through Meta-analysis of preclinical studies.

METHODS:
Three major databases, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science (including medline), were searched in English until December 2022.The quality of the including literature was assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Review Manager 5.3 was used to statistically summarize the included studies and the statistical effect values were expressed by SMD. The outcomes included: behavioral tests (escape latency, number of crossings), pathological sections (Nissl and TUNEL staining), oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX) and neuroinflammatory factors (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6).

RESULTS:
A total of 31 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the escape latency, the contents of ROS, MDA, IL-1Î², and IL-6 were decreased, and the contents of SOD and Nissl-positive neurons were increased in the acupuncture group as compared with the non-group (Pâ<â.05). Compared with the impaired group, the acupuncture group also had the above advantages (Pâ<â.05). In addition, the acupuncture group also increased the number of crossings and GSH-PX content, and decreased the expression of TUNEL-positive neurons and TNF-Î± (Pâ<â.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
From behavioral tests to slices and pathological markers in animal models of vascular dementia, it can be proved that acupuncture is effective in targeting oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory damage, and acupuncture is not a placebo effect. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to the gap between animal experiments and clinical applications.","Vascular dementia is a cognitive dysfunction syndrome caused by cerebral vascular factors such as ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The effect of acupuncture on vascular dementia models is ambiguous, and there is controversy about whether acupuncture has a placebo effect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are the most essential mechanisms in preclinical studies of vascular dementia. However, there is no meta-analysis on the mechanism of vascular dementia in animal models. It is necessary to explore the efficacy of acupuncture through Meta-analysis of preclinical studies.","Three major databases, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science (including medline), were searched in English until December 2022.The quality of the including literature was assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Review Manager 5.3 was used to statistically summarize the included studies and the statistical effect values were expressed by SMD. The outcomes included: behavioral tests (escape latency, number of crossings), pathological sections (Nissl and TUNEL staining), oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX) and neuroinflammatory factors (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6).","A total of 31 articles were included in this meta-analysis.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,A systematic review of the Woven EndoBridge device-do findings in pre-clinical animal models compare to clinical results?,"BACKGROUND:
The Woven Endobridge (WEB) is designed to treat intracranial wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, preventing subarachnoid hemorrhage. The translational value of animal models used for WEB device testing is unknown. With this systematic review, we aim to identify the existing animal models used in testing the WEB device and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes to those of prospective clinical studies.

METHODS:
This study was funded by ZonMw: project number 114024133. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed and in EMBASE via the Ovid interface. The following exclusion criteria were used: 1) not an original full-length research paper, 2) not an in vivo animal study or a human study, 3) no WEB implantation, 4) if in humans: not a prospective study. The SYRCLE risk of bias tool (animal studies) and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for cohort studies (clinical studies) were used to assess risks of bias. A narrative synthesis was performed.

RESULTS:
Six animal studies and 17 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria. The rabbit elastase aneurysm model was the only animal model used to assess WEB device performance. Safety outcomes were never reported in animal studies. Efficacy outcomes were more heterogeneous in animal studies than in clinical studies, which could be due to limited external validity of the animal models in terms of aneurysm induction and dimensions. Both animal and clinical studies were predominantly single-arm studies, and were at unclear risk of several types of bias.

CONCLUSIONS:
The rabbit elastase aneurysm model was the only pre-clinical animal model used to assess WEB device performance. Safety outcomes were not evaluated in animal studies and could therefore not be compared to clinical outcomes. Efficacy outcomes were more heterogeneous in animal studies than in clinical studies. Future research should focus on improving methodology and reporting in order to draw accurate conclusions on the performance of the WEB device.","The Woven Endobridge (WEB) is designed to treat intracranial wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, preventing subarachnoid hemorrhage.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Combining robot-assisted therapy with virtual reality or using it alone? A systematic review on health-related quality of life in neurological patients.,"BACKGROUND:
In the field of neurorehabilitation, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) have so far shown promising evidence on multiple motor and functional outcomes. The related effectiveness on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been investigated across neurological populations but still remains unclear. The present study aimed to systematically review the studies investigating the effects of RAT alone and with VR on HRQoL in patients with different neurological diseases.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the studies evaluating the impact of RAT alone and combined with VR on HRQoL in patients affected by neurological diseases (i.e., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's Disease) was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, and PsychINFO (2000-2022) were performed. Risk of bias was evaluated through the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Descriptive data regarding the study design, participants, intervention, rehabilitation outcomes, robotic device typology, HRQoL measures, non-motor factors concurrently investigated, and main results were extracted and meta-synthetized.

RESULTS:
The searches identified 3025 studies, of which 70 met the inclusion criteria. An overall heterogeneous configuration was found regarding the study design adopted, intervention procedures and technological devices implemented, rehabilitation outcomes (i.e., related to both upper and lower limb impairment), HRQoL measures administered, and main evidence. Most of the studies reported significant effects of both RAT and RAT plus VR on patients HRQoL, whether they adopted generic or disease-specific HRQoL measures. Significant post-intervention within-group changes were mainly found across neurological populations, while fewer studies reported significant between-group comparisons, and then, mostly in patients with stroke. Longitudinal investigations were also observed (up to 36Â months), but significant longitudinal effects were exclusively found in patients with stroke or multiple sclerosis. Finally, concurrent evaluations on non-motor outcomes beside HRQoL included cognitive (i.e., memory, attention, executive functions) and psychological (i.e., mood, satisfaction with the treatment, device usability, fear of falling, motivation, self-efficacy, coping, and well-being) variables.

CONCLUSIONS:
Despite the heterogeneity observed among the studies included, promising evidence was found on the effectiveness of RAT and RAT plus VR on HRQoL. However, further targeted short- and long-term investigations, are strongly recommended for specific HRQoL subcomponents and neurological populations, through the adoption of defined intervention procedures and disease-specific assessment methodology.","In the field of neurorehabilitation, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and virtual reality (VR) have so far shown promising evidence on multiple motor and functional outcomes.

Significant post-intervention within-group changes were mainly found across neurological populations, while fewer studies reported significant between-group comparisons, and then, mostly in patients with stroke. Longitudinal investigations were also observed (up to 36 months), but significant longitudinal effects were exclusively found in patients with stroke or multiple sclerosis. Finally, concurrent evaluations on non-motor outcomes beside HRQoL included cognitive (i.e., memory, attention, executive functions) and psychological (i.e., mood, satisfaction with the treatment, device usability, fear of falling, motivation, self-efficacy, coping, and well-being) variables.

Despite the heterogeneity observed among the studies included, promising evidence was found on the effectiveness of RAT and RAT plus VR on HRQoL.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Is ventricular lavage a novel treatment of neonatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus? a meta analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) may produce obliterative arachnoiditis, which disrupts the flow and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). PHH gives a high risk of neurofunctional impairment. Ventricular lavage is the treatment of choice for PHH in neonates with IVH for decades. It is developing with the combination of fibrinolytic therapy, also called drainage, irrigation, and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT), and with the use of neuroendoscopic apparatus, also called neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL).

METHODS:
This review is a meta-analysis using the PRISMA method guideline, including the clinical studies comparing ventricular lavage (VL) with standard treatment of PHH between 2000 and 2021.

RESULTS:
VL group reduced the shunt dependency compared to standard treatment (ORâ=â0.22; 95CI 0.05 to 0.97; pâ=â0.05). VL group has less infection risk compared to the standard treatment group (RRâ=â0.20; 95CI 0.07 to 0.59; pâ<â0.05). The severe neurofunctional outcome is similar between the two groups (ORâ=â0.99; 95CI 0.13 to 7.23; pâ=â0.99). The early approach treatment group may give better neurofunctional outcomes compared to the late approach (ORâ=â0.14; 95CI 0.06 to 0.35; pâ<â0.05).

CONCLUSION:
VL reduce the shunt dependency on the PHH, decreasing the shunt's related infection rate. The early ventricular lavage may give benefit for the neurocognitive outcome.","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) may produce obliterative arachnoiditis, which disrupts the flow and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH).

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,How do interventions to improve the efficiency of acute stroke care affect prehospital times? A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"BACKGROUND:
Emergency medical services (EMS) are the first point of contact for most acute stroke patients. EMS call to hospital times have increased in recent years for stroke patients in the UK which is undesirable due to the relationship between time and effectiveness of reperfusion treatment. This review aimed to identify and describe interventions devised to improve the efficiency of acute stroke care which reported an impact on ground-based EMS call to hospital times.

METHODS:
A systematic review of published literature identified from five databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane library and the Database of Research in Stroke (DORIS)) from January 2000 to December 2020 with narrative synthesis was conducted. Inclusion criteria were primary studies of ground-based EMS, focused on stroke and aiming to improve EMS times. Papers published before 2000, focussing on mobile stroke units or in languages other than English were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened prospective titles. Cochrane ROB2 and ROBINS-I tools were used to assess for risk of bias. This review was funded by a Stroke Association fellowship.

RESULTS:
From 3767 initial records, 11 studies were included in the review. Included studies were categorised into three groups: studies targeting EMS dispatch and EMS clinicians (nÂ =â4); studies targeting EMS clinicians only (nâ=â4); and studies targeting whole system change (nÂ =â3). Suspected stroke patients were the primary population studied and most (nÂ =â10) interventions involved clinician education. Only one study (9%) reported a significant decrease in call to hospital time in one subgroup whereas two studies (18%) reported a significant increase in call to hospital time and all other studies (73%) reported no significant change.

CONCLUSIONS:
Based on the included studies, interventions intended to improve the efficiency of the acute stroke pathway rarely improved EMS call to hospital times. Included studies were heterogenous and rarely focussed on the review topic which limits the usability of the findings. Further research is needed to explore the trade-off between changes to EMS stroke care and call to hospital times and subsequent impacts on in-hospital care and patient outcomes.",Emergency medical services (EMS) are the first point of contact for most acute stroke patients.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,"Intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion; should we cross that bridge? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 36,123 patients.","BACKGROUND:
The use of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) is a debatable subject in the field of neuro-interventional surgery. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence from published studies on the outcomes of IVTâ+âMT compared with MT alone in AIS-LVO patients.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to January 2022 for relevant clinical trials and observational studies. Eligible studies were identified, and all relevant outcomes were pooled in the meta-analysis DerSimonian-Liard random-effects model.

RESULTS:
Forty-nine studies, with a total of 36,123 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. IVTâ+âMT was significantly superior to MT alone in terms of successful recanalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09), mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.82), favorable functional outcome (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29), and complete recanalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of improvement of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24Â h or at discharge (pâ>â0.05). Complications including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), procedure-related complications, and parenchymal hematoma were comparable between the two groups (pâ>â0.05).

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Are beta blockers effective in preventing stroke-associated infections? - a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Excessive sympathoexcitation could lead to stroke associated infection. Inhibiting sympathetic excitation may reduce the infection risk after stroke. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the protective effect of beta blockers on stroke associated infection through systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
A systematic search of multiple databases were performed up to February 2022. The included studies required beta blockers therapy in stroke patients and assessed the incidence of stroke-associated infections. Outcomes of interest included infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis. Random-effects model was used for analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics and publication bias was evaluated by the funnel plot.

RESULT:
A total of 83 potentially relevant publications was identified in the initial search. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The risk of bias in the included articles satisfies the quality requirement of meta-analysis. No significant associations between beta blockers therapy and the prevention of stroke associated infection, stroke associated pneumonia and septicemia were found, However, subgroup analyses revealed an association between beta blockers treatment and the increased risk of post-stroke urinary tract infection or stroke associated pneumonia in some stroke patients (OR = 1.69 [1.33, 2.14], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR = 1.85 [1.51, 2.26], <i>P</i> < 0.0001).

CONCLUSION:
Due to the lack of robust evidence, this meta-analysis may not support the preventive effect of beta blockers on stroke associated infection. But beta blockers treatment may be associated with development of post-stroke urinary tract infection and stroke associated pneumonia in some stroke patients.","Excessive sympathoexcitation could lead to stroke associated infection.

cardiovascular medicine,cerebrovascular disease,Does acupuncture therapy improve language function of patients with aphasia following ischemic stroke? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Aphasia is one of the most common complications in patients with ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that acupuncture can improve the symptoms of aphasia patients. However, the effect of acupuncture on language function in patients with ischemic stroke is still controversial.

OBJECTIVE:
This study aimed to critically assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for aphasia following ischemic stroke.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Digital Periodicals, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals database were searched. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the criteria were included.

RESULTS:
Meta-analyses showed that mean difference in change of auditory comprehension score (MDâ=â7.71, 95% CI: 1.83 to 13.59, Pâ=â0.01), spontaneous speech (MDâ=â2.77, 95% CI: 0.59 to 4.95, Pâ=â0.01), repetition score (MDâ=â14.48, 95% CI: 11.04 to 17.91, Pâ<â0.00001) and naming score (MDâ=â14.60, 95% CI: 11.33 to 17.88, Pâ<â0.00001) measured by WAB scale were statistically significant. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that there were statistically significant mean differences in four items of WAB scale in patients with sub-acute stroke, and no statistically significant differences in patients with acute stroke.

CONCLUSION:
The present study suggests that acupuncture may improve the language function of patients with aphasia following ischemic stroke, especially during the sub-acute phase.

cardiovascular medicine,coronary heart disease,Is elevated triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio associated with poor prognosis of coronary heart disease? A meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Elevated triglycerides (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are recognized as essential and independent hazard factors for total death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, whether the increased TG/HDL-C forecasted the prognosis of CHD is still unknown. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the elevated TG/HDL-C ratio and poor prognosis of CHD.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, until August 30, 2021. Prospective observational studies regarding the association between TG/HDL-C and long-term mortality/MACEs in CHD patients were included.

RESULTS:
In total, 6 independent prospective studies of 10,222 participants with CHD were enrolled in the systematic and meta-analysis. Our outcomes of the meta-analysis indicated that the elevated TG/HDL-C group had a significantly increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75-4.86, P < .05) and long-term MACEs (HR = 1.56, 95%CI 1.11-2.18, P < .05).

CONCLUSION:
In patients with CHD, the present study showed that the high TG/HDL-C was associated with increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality and MACE.","Elevated triglycerides (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are recognized as essential and independent hazard factors for total death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, whether the increased TG/HDL-C forecasted the prognosis of CHD is still unknown. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the elevated TG/HDL-C ratio and poor prognosis of CHD.","A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, until August 30, 2021. Prospective observational studies regarding the association between TG/HDL-C and long-term mortality/MACEs in CHD patients were included.","In total, 6 independent prospective studies of 10,222 participants with CHD were enrolled in the systematic and meta-analysis.

cardiovascular medicine,coronary heart disease,Is there an association between intravenous immunoglobulin resistance and coronary artery lesion in Kawasaki disease?-Current evidence based on a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Coronary artery lesion (CAL) caused by Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. Initial treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can reduce the incidence of CAL. Although most of the current studies have shown a certain correlation between CAL and IVIG resistance, the conclusions are not completely consistent. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between IVIG resistance and CAL in KD.

METHODS:
PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure through April 21, 2020 were searched to detect relevant studies. Data analysis was performed with STATA 15.1.

RESULTS:
A total of 53 relevant studies were eligible to this analysis, including 30312 KD patients, of which 4750 were IVIG resistance and 25562 were responders. There was a significant difference found between IVIG resistance and IVIG response groups in the incidence of CAL (P < 0.001, odds ratio (OR), 3.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.18, 4.75)). The heterogeneity test results showed that the I2 value was 74.8%. The meta-regression analysis showed that the study regions might be the sources of heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis suggested that the incidence of CAL in the IVIG resistance group was still higher than that in the IVIG response group under different regions, IVIG resistance diagnostic criteria, CAL diagnostic criteria, and study types. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis did not find any significant impact from every single study.

CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first meta-analysis to reveal the incidence of CAL was associated with IVIG resistance in KD patients. Further well-designed studies with uniform criteria are needed to evaluate the incidence of CAL in IVIG resistant patients.","Coronary artery lesion (CAL) caused by Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children.

cardiovascular medicine,coronary heart disease,Percutaneous Intervention or Bypass Graft for Left Main Coronary Artery Disease? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for stable left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) remains controversial.

METHODS:
Digital databases were searched to compare the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and its components. A random effect model was used to compute an unadjusted odds ratio (OR).

RESULTS:
A total of 43 studies (37 observational and 6 RCTs) consisting of 29,187 patients (PCI 13,709 and CABG 15,478) were identified. The 30-day rate of MACCE (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42-0.76; <i>p</i>â=â0.0002) and all-cause mortality (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.91; <i>p</i>â=â0.02) was significantly lower in the PCI group. There was no significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) (<i>p</i>â=â0.17) and revascularization (<i>p</i>â=â0.12). At 5 years, CABG was favored due to a significantly lower rate of MACCE (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18-2.36; <i>p</i>â=â<0.04), MI (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.35-2.06; <i>p</i>â=â<0.00001), and revascularization (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.18-3.60; <i>p</i>â=â<0.00001), respectively. PCI was associated with a lower overall rate of a stroke, while the risk of all-cause mortality was not significantly different between the two groups at 1- (<i>p</i>â=â0.75), 5- (<i>p</i>â=â0.72), and 10-years (<i>p</i>â=â0.20). The Kaplan-Meier curve reconstruction revealed substantial variations over time; the 5-year incidence of MACCE was 38% with CABG, significantly lower than 45% with PCI (<i>p</i>â=â<0.00001).

cardiovascular medicine,hypertension,Nifedipine or amlodipine? The choice for hypertension during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
There is a lack of sufficient evidence regarding efficacy and safety of amlodipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE:
To compare antihypertensive efficacy, pregnancy outcome and safety of amlodipine with nifedipine on hypertension during pregnancy.

METHODS:
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine disc of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April l5, 2021 was conducted on RCTs comparing amlodipine to nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. To estimate relative effects from all available evidence, a meta-analysis was conducted.

RESULTS:
Seventeen RCTs were included. Amlodipine was found the efficacy is slightly superior to nifedipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10) with a decreased risk for maternal side effects (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.61). Subgroup analysis found amlodipine can get a better control on SBP (RR -Â 11.68, 95% CI -Â 17.98 to -Â 5.37) and DBP (RR -Â 7.44, 95% CI -Â 13.81 to -Â 1.06) compared with intermediate-/long-acting nifedipine. In addition, there was no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine on pregnancy outcomes including caesarean section, premature labour, placental abruption, FGR, fetal distress, neonatal asphyxia.

CONCLUSIONS:
Given the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, amlodipine can be effectively and safely used for hypertension during pregnancy.","To compare antihypertensive efficacy, pregnancy outcome and safety of amlodipine with nifedipine on hypertension during pregnancy.","A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine disc of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April l5, 2021 was conducted on RCTs comparing amlodipine to nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy.

cardiovascular medicine,lipid disorders,Does chronic high-intensity endurance training have an effect on cardiovascular markers of active populations and athletes? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to ascertain the effects of high-intensity chronic endurance training on cardiovascular markers of active populations and athletes.

METHODS:
This review was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We used databases of PubMed, Science Direct, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar and grey literatures with Mesh and free-text search as well as manual searches to identify relevant studies from June 2017 to September 2019. Weighted standardised mean differences and effect size of the intervention group versus the control group were calculated using a random effect model with 95% CI.

RESULT:
There was significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-1.06 (-1.83 to -0.30), p=0.006. We have also observed a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-0.97 (-1.58 to -0.36), p=0.002, and = -0.78 (-1.34 to -0.22), p=0.007, respectively. There was a significant reduction in interleukin 6 (IL-6) using a fixed effect model with weighted standardised mean difference and effect size=-0.87 (-1.33 to -0.40), p=0.0003 and C reactive protein (CRP) with weighted standardised mean differences and effect size=-0.41 (-0.73 to -0.09), p=0.01.

CONCLUSION:
Chronic high-intensity endurance training improves healthy lipid profiles (increase high-density lipoprotein, decreased low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol). And decreased inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) independent of age and sex and cannot be associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

cardiovascular medicine,lipid disorders,Are women with type 2 diabetes mellitus more susceptible to cardiovascular complications following coronary angioplasty?: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Scientific reports have shown Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to be independently associated with adverse outcomes following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). However, gender difference has also often been a controversial issue following PCI. Till date, very few meta-analyses have systematically compared the adverse cardiovascular outcomes in male versus female patients with T2DM following PCI. Therefore, we aimed to carry out this analysis in order to find out an answer to this interesting question.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were searched for English language publications reporting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in male versus female patients with diabetes mellitus respectively following coronary angioplasty. The RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze selected adverse cardiovascular events whereby Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were the statistical parameters.

RESULTS:
A total number of 19,304 patients with T2DM (12,986 male patients versus 6318 female patients) were included in this analysis. At baseline, female patients were older (68.7 versus 62.9Â years), with a higher percentage of hypertension (75.6% versus 66.5%) and dyslipidemia (53.3% versus 50.0%) whereas majority of the male patients were smokers (46.3% versus 14.9%). Results of this analysis showed short and long-term mortality to be significantly higher in female patients with T2DM (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.46-2.00; PÂ =Â 0.00001), and (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35; PÂ =Â 0.002) respectively. In addition, women were also more at risk for short and long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) with OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07; PÂ =Â 0.02 and OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.28; PÂ =Â 0.009 respectively. Subgroup analysis showed this significant result to have mainly been observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared to those with stable coronary artery disease.

CONCLUSIONS:
Following PCI, women with T2DM were indeed more susceptible to short and long-term cardiovascular complications compared to male patients with the same chronic disease. Even though this result was more applicable to patients with acute myocardial infarction, the fact that women were older with higher co-morbidities at baseline compared to men, should also not be ignored.","Scientific reports have shown Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to be independently associated with adverse outcomes following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).

dermatology,acne,Is acne in adolescence associated with prostate cancer risk? Evidence from a meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Previous studies regarding the relationship between acne and prostate cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We performed the present meta-analysis of observational studies to summarize the evidence on this association.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search up to March 2018 was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with a random effects model. The Q statistic and the I2 index were used to evaluate the heterogeneity across the studies.

RESULTS:
Eight studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, no significant association was found between acne and prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.25). A significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (P = 0.006, I2 = 64.5%). In the subgroup analysis by study design, a significant association was observed in the cohort studies (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.93) but not in the case-control studies (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.86-1.12).

CONCLUSIONS:
In summary, this meta-analysis did not find an association between acne in adolescence and prostate cancer risk. However, because there was some heterogeneity in the overall analysis and a significant association was observed in the meta-analysis of the cohort studies, further well-designed large prospective studies are warranted to confirm our results.",Previous studies regarding the relationship between acne and prostate cancer risk have reported inconsistent results.

dermatology,dermatitis,What is the evidence for interactions between filaggrin null mutations and environmental exposures in the aetiology of atopic dermatitis? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Epidemiological studies indicate that gene-environment interactions play a role in atopic dermatitis (AD).

OBJECTIVES:
To review the evidence for gene-environment interactions in AD aetiology, focusing on filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function mutations.

METHODS:
A systematic search from inception to September 2018 in Embase, MEDLINE and BIOSIS was performed. Search terms included all synonyms for AD and filaggrin/FLG; any genetic or epidemiological study design using any statistical methods were included. Quality assessment using criteria modified from guidance (ROBINS-I and Human Genome Epidemiology Network) for nonrandomized and genetic studies was completed, including consideration of power. Heterogeneity of study design and analyses precluded the use of meta-analysis.

RESULTS:
Of 1817 papers identified, 12 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria required and performed formal interaction testing. There was some evidence for FLG-environment interactions in six of the studies (P-value for interaction â¤ 0Â·05), including early-life cat ownership, older siblings, water hardness, phthalate exposure, higher urinary phthalate metabolite levels (which all increased AD risk additional to FLG null genotype) and prolonged breastfeeding (which decreased AD risk in the context of FLG null genotype). Major limitations of published studies were the low numbers of individuals (ranging from five to 94) with AD and FLG loss-of-function mutations and exposure to specific environmental factors, and variation in exposure definitions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Evidence on FLG-environment interactions in AD aetiology is limited. However, many of the studies lacked large enough sample sizes to assess these interactions fully. Further research is needed with larger sample sizes and clearly defined exposure assessment. Linked Comment:Â Park and Seo.

dermatology,dermatologic surgery,Is Orbicularis Oculi Muscle Resection Necessary in Upper Blepharoplasty? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Our objective is to evaluate the evidence on the aesthetic effect and complications of skin-OOM strip resection compared to skin only upper blepharoplasty.

METHODS:
A systematic search of EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases was performed using our search strategy through to 31 December 2019. Only comparative studies of the two upper blepharoplasty techniques were included. Three reviewers performed study selection process, data extraction, and quality assessment.

RESULTS:
A total of six articles were eligible for final inclusion. The included studies consist of two controlled retrospective cohorts and four small randomized controlled studies (RCT). Three of which, were double blinded. Those RCTs were assigned level 2 evidence due to small size and methodological limitations. The sample size of included was studies 407 in the two retrospective studies and 57 in the four RCTs. The outcomes showed that resection of OOM along with skin in upper blepharoplasty showed no difference in long-term aesthetic outcome when skin only procedure is performed. Muscle strip resection was associated with initially higher ophthalmological morbidity (edema, bruising, pain, dry eye, sluggish eye closure and lagopthalmos). Those resolved aÂ few weeks later with conservative treatment.

CONCLUSION:
The resection of OOM along with skin in upper blepharoplasty showed no difference in long-term aesthetic outcome and was associated with initially higher ophthalmological morbidity compared to skin only procedure. While we are not suggesting that OOM resection is never required, the evidence strongly support its preservation during standard upper blepharoplasty.

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Does oral lichen planus aggravate the state of periodontal disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) was to assess the evidence between the association of oral lichen planus and periodontal disease, evaluating the periodontal clinical parameters and biomarkers levels.

METHODS:
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181513). Searches were accomplished in databases for articles published until June 2021. The meta-analysis was performed with the variables: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). The mean difference was applied with a 95% confidence interval.

RESULTS:
Six articles were included. Qualitative analysis showed the levels of biomarkers (matrix metalloproteinases, interleukins, and periodontal microbiological profile) are increased in subjects with periodontal disease and oral lichen planus. In the meta-analysis, these subjects also presented increases in all periodontal clinical parameters evaluated: GI-gingivitis 0.22 [0.14, 0.31] pâ<â0.0001 and periodontitis 0.12 [0.06, 0.19]Â pâ=â0.0003; PI-gingivitis 0.22 [0.12, 0.31] pâ<â0.0001 and periodontitis 0.15 [0.08, 0.23] pâ<â0.0001; PD-gingivitis 0.27 [0.06; 0.48] pâ=â0.0107 and periodontitis 0.11 [0.01; 0.21] pâ=â0.0299; and CA-periodontitis 0.06 [0.01, 0.12] pâ=â0.0176.

CONCLUSIONS:
Evidence suggests a significant relationship between the severity of periodontal disease and the presence of oral lichen planus. Although the association is biologically plausible, further studies are needed using populations and well-defined biochemical and clinical outcomes with consideration of potential confounding factors.

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Is there a relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C? A meta-analysis and bioinformatics investigation.,"BACKGROUND:
The relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C was previously controversial, so our purpose is to investigate this connection.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review of the case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and hepatitis C in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and investigated the overlapping genes between psoriasis targets and hepatitis C targets using bioinformatics analysis.Â Based on overlapping genes and hub nodes, we also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module respectively, followed by the pathway enrichment analysis.

RESULTS:
We included 11 publications that reported a total of 11 studies (8 cross-sectional and 3 case-control). The case-control and cross-sectional studies included 25,047 psoriasis patients and 4,091,631 controls in total. Psoriasis was associated with a significant increase of prevalent hepatitis C (OR 1.72;Â 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.17-2.52)). A total of 389 significant genes were common to both hepatitis C and psoriasis, which mainly involved IL6, TNF, IL10, ALB, STAT3 and CXCL8. The module and pathway enrichment analyses showed that the common genes had the potential to influence varieties of biological pathways, including the inflammatory response, cytokine activity, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C and psoriasis.

CONCLUSION:
Patients with psoriasis display increased prevalence of hepatitis C and the basic related mechanisms between hepatitis C and psoriasis had been preliminarily clarified.","The relationship between psoriasis and hepatitis C was previously controversial, so our purpose is to investigate this connection.","We conducted a systematic review of the case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and hepatitis C in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and investigated the overlapping genes between psoriasis targets and hepatitis C targets using bioinformatics analysis.Â Based on overlapping genes and hub nodes, we also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module respectively, followed by the pathway enrichment analysis.","We included 11 publications that reported a total of 11 studies (8 cross-sectional and 3 case-control).

dermatology,papulosquamous disorders,Is oral lichen planus a risk factor for peri-implant diseases? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
To evaluate whether oral lichen planus (OLP) is a risk factor for peri-implant diseases (PIDs) with a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
Five electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched. The included studies are observational human studies written in English. The population of interest included those with/without OLP who received dental implant treatment. The follow-up time after implantation was from 1 month to 20âyears. The quality of the included articles regarding risk of bias and methodology were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data involving exposure (OLP), primary outcomes (implants having PIDs) and secondary outcomes (probing depth/PD, bleeding on probing/BOP and bone loss/BL) and potential confounders were extracted. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sup>2</sup> test. Dichotomous data are expressed as the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) which were calculated with a fixed effect model.

RESULTS:
Of the 66 articles, two studies were enrolled and evaluated as high quality, which totally contained 68 participants receiving 222 (OLP vs. non-OLP, 112 vs. 110) implants with 12 to 120-month follow-up time. Proportions of implants with PIDs between OLP and non-OLP groups were as follows: 19.6% (22/112) vs. 22.7% (25/110) for PIM and 17.0% (19/112) vs. 10.9% (12/110) for PI. The meta-analysis revealed no recognizable difference in number of implants with PIDs (PI: RRâ=â1.49, 95% CI 0.77-2.90, Pâ=â0.24; PIM:RRâ=â0.88, 95% CI 0.53-1.46, Pâ=â0.61; PIDs: RRâ=â1.08, 95% CI 0.75-1.55, Pâ=â0.68) or BOP (RRâ=â0.90, 95% CI: 0.70-1.15, Pâ=â0.40) between OLP and non-OLP groups.

CONCLUSIONS:
Available articles regarding the effects of OLP on PIDs remains very limited. Existing evidence does not support OLP as a suspected risk factor for PIDs.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Does cone-beam computed tomography examination increase the micronuclei frequency in the oral mucosa exfoliated cells? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
This systematic review (SR) with meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the frequency of micronuclei in the oral mucosa exfoliated cells after cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination.

METHODS:
We performed language-independent computer-assisted data searches using PubMed databases, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science all databases, and Google Scholar. The literature on micronucleus (MN) frequency of clinical trials before and after CBCT examination was included. The frequency of MN in exfoliated cells of the human oral mucosa was the primary outcome of the study. All statistical analyses were performed with R (version 4.1.0), RStudio (version 2022.02.2â+â485) software, and Meta packages (version 5.2-0). Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies by the EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project) Modified scale with minor modifications. The heterogeneity of the data was analyzed using I<sup>2</sup> statistics, in which I<sup>2</sup>â>â50% was considered substantial heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
A total of 559 articles were selected through the search strategy. After screening titles and abstracts, nine full-text manuscripts were assessed for eligibility, and six observational studies were included in the meta-analysis. The present study showed a significant increase in MN frequency of human oral mucosal exfoliated cells 10Â days after CBCT examination compared to baseline (SMDâ=â-â0.56, 95%-CIâ=â-â0.99â~â-â0.13, pâ=â0.01). Because of the high heterogeneity among the studies (I<sup>2</sup>â=â72%), after removing one study that was the main source of heterogeneity, excluding the study (I<sup>2</sup>â=â47%), the common-effect model was chosen, and the meta-analysis also showed that the frequency of MN in human oral mucosa exfoliated cells increased significantly 10Â days after CBCT examination (SMDâ=ââ-â0.35, 95%-CIâ=ââ-â0.59â~ââ-â0.11, pâ=â0.004).

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Do COVID-19 CT features vary between patients from within and outside mainland China? Findings from a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Chest computerized tomography (CT) plays an important role in detecting patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there are no systematic summaries on whether the chest CT findings of patients within mainland China are applicable to those found in patients outside.

METHODS:
Relevant studies were retrieved comprehensively by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases before 15 April 2022. Quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies, which were divided into two groups according to whether they were in mainland China or outside. Data on diagnostic performance, unilateral or bilateral lung involvement, and typical chest CT imaging appearances were extracted, and then, meta-analyses were performed with R software to compare the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia between patients from within and outside mainland China.

RESULTS:
Of the 8,258 studies screened, 19 studies with 3,400 patients in mainland China and 14 studies with 554 outside mainland China were included. Overall, the risk of quality assessment and publication bias was low. The diagnostic value of chest CT is similar between patients from within and outside mainland China (93, 91%). The pooled incidence of unilateral lung involvement (15, 7%), the crazy-paving sign (31, 21%), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations (51, 35%), air bronchogram (44, 25%), vascular engorgement (59, 33%), bronchial wall thickening (19, 12%), and septal thickening (39, 26%) in patients from mainland China were significantly higher than those from outside; however, the incidence rates of bilateral lung involvement (75, 84%), GGO (78, 87%), consolidations (45, 58%), nodules (12, 17%), and pleural effusion (9, 15%) were significantly lower.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Can quantitative peritumoral CT radiomics features predict the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES:
To provide an overarching evaluation of the value of peritumoral CT radiomics features for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and to assess the quality of the available studies.

METHODS:
The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies predicting the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using CT-based peritumoral radiomics features. Information about the patient, CT-scanner, and radiomics analyses were all extracted for the included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies were included with 2942 patients from 2017 to 2022. Only one study was prospective, and the others were all retrospectively designed. Manual segmentation and multicenter studies were performed by 69% and 46% of the included studies, respectively. 3D-Slicer and MATLAB software were most commonly used for the segmentation of lesions and extraction of features. The peritumoral region was most frequently defined as dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm, 20 mm, or 30 mm. The median RQS of the studies was 13 (range 4-19), while all of included studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias (ROB) overall.

CONCLUSIONS:
Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images showed promise in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC, although well-designed studies and further biological validation are still needed.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Distal tibial tubercle osteotomy can lessen change in patellar height post medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is a mainstream surgical method for treating early medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Undesirable sequelae such as patella infera may happen following tuberosity osteotomy. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the change in patellar position after proximal tibial tubercle osteotomy (PTO) versus distal tibial tubercle osteotomy (DTO) intervention.

METHODS:
The 11 studies were acquired from PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library. The data were extracted by two of the coauthors independently and were analyzed by RevMan5.3. Mean differences, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess risk of bias.

RESULTS:
Eleven observational studies were assessed. The methodological quality of the trials ranged from moderate to high. The pooled results of postoperative patellar height (Caton-Deschamps index and Blackburne-Peel index) and postoperative complications showed that the differences were statistically significant between PTO and DTO interventions. Patellar index ratios decreased significantly in the PTO groups, and 12 (9.2%) complications under DTO surgery and 2 (1.6%) complications under PTO surgery were reported. The differences of postoperative posterior tibial slope (angle) was not statistically significant, but postoperative posterior tibial slope of both groups increased. Sensitivity analysis proved the stability of the pooled results and the publication bias was not apparent.

CONCLUSIONS:
DTO in MOWHTO maintained the postoperative patellar height, and clinically, for patients with serious patellofemoral osteoarthritis, DTO can be preferred. Postoperative complications are easily preventable with caution. In view of the heterogeneity and small sample size, whether these conclusions are applicable should be further determined in future studies.",Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is a mainstream surgical method for treating early medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Can Weightbearing Cone-beam CT Reliably Differentiate Between Stable and Unstable Syndesmotic Ankle Injuries? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Ankle injuries are common presentations to the emergency department and may lead to syndesmotic instability. These have a high socioeconomic burden due to prolonged rehabilitation, chronic pain, and posttraumatic arthritis. Early diagnosis is essential to minimize these complications, and the assessment of instability in the clinical setting is often limited by pain and clinician experience. Cross-sectional imaging of the distal syndesmosis accurately evaluates the syndesmosis through abnormal bony relationships, which in the presence of instability, worsens during physiological loading. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) has gained popularity in the diagnosis of these injuries because it enables syndesmotic assessment under weightbearing conditions, it mitigates the high radiation dose, and it is time-efficient.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
The purposes of this systematic review were: (1) to establish normal values for weightbearing CBCT of the syndesmosis in uninjured ankles and ascertain interobserver reliability and (2) to identify the impact of weightbearing on the syndesmosis in patients with occult ankle injuries and assess the effect of patient demographics on these metrics.

METHODS:
This systematic review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42021248623). MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Emcare databases were searched for studies assessing for syndesmotic instability, of which 307 studies were screened and 11 studies with 559 ankles in 408 uninjured patients and 151 patients with syndesmotic instability were included. All patients 18 years of age or older presenting with unilateral ankle injuries who underwent weightbearing CBCT for the diagnosis of an occult fracture or syndesmotic instability compared with the uninjured contralateral side were included. A control group of uninjured ankles was identified during weightbearing CBCT performed for other indications such as forefoot or midfoot injuries. Methodological assessment of the studies was performed using the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies (ROBINS-1) tool and most included studies had a low risk of bias. Thus, a random-effects restricted maximum likelihood ratio model was used.

RESULTS:
In the uninjured ankle, the mean area of the tibiofibular syndesmosis was 112.5 Â± 7.1 mm 2 , which increased to 157.5 Â± 9.6 mm 2 after injury when compared with uninjured ankles with a standardized mean difference of 29.5 (95% confidence interval 19.5 to 39.5; p < 0.01), and an excellent interobserver agreement (Îº = 1.0 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.0]). However, syndesmosis volume decreased with age (Î² = -0.76; p = 0.04), and therefore, has a negative association with increasing age.

CONCLUSION:
Our study has shown that the syndesmotic area is the most reliable parameter in the assessment of syndesmotic injuries because it increases in the presence of instability during weightbearing status. It is a composite measurement that could potentially allow clinicians to use weightbearing CBCT as an adjunct when there is a clinical suspicion of syndesmotic instability. Thus, weightbearing CBCT has the potential of being diagnostic of syndesmotic instability and should be evaluated against current radiological modalities to evaluate its accuracy.

diagnostic radiology,diagnostic radiology,Can gray values be converted to Hounsfield units? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this systematic review was to answer the focus question: ""Could the gray values (GVs) from CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) be converted to Hounsfield units (HUs) in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)?""

METHODS:
The included studies try to answer the research question according to the PICO strategy. Studies were gathered by searching several electronic databases and partial grey literature up to January 2021 without language or time restrictions. The methodological assessment of the studies was performed using The Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) for <i>in vitro</i> studies and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) for <i>in vivo</i> studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE system) instrument was applied to assess the level of evidence across the studies.

RESULTS:
2710 articles were obtained in Phase 1, and 623 citations remained after removing duplicates. Only three studies were included in this review using a two-phase selection process and after applying the eligibility criteria. All studies were methodologically acceptable, although in general terms with low risks of bias. There are some included studies with quite low and limited evidence estimations and recommendation forces; evidencing the need for clinical studies with diagnostic capacity to support its use.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review demonstrated that the GVs from CBCT cannot be converted to HUs due to the lack of clinical studies with diagnostic capacity to support its use. However, it is evidenced that three conversion steps (equipment calibration, prediction equation models, and a standard formula (converting GVs to HUs)) are needed to obtain pseudo Hounsfield values instead of only obtaining them from a regression or directly from the software.","The purpose of this systematic review was to answer the focus question: ""Could the gray values (GVs) from CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) be converted to Hounsfield units (HUs) in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)?""","The included studies try to answer the research question according to the PICO strategy.

diagnostic radiology,computed tomography,When is a Ghost Really Gone? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Accuracy of Imaging Modalities to Predict Complete Pathological Response of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases After Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND:
Administration of chemotherapy to patients with colorectal liver metastases may result in disappearing liver metastases (DLM). This poses a therapeutic dilemma due to the uncertainty of true complete (pathological) response.

OBJECTIVE:
We aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in detecting true complete response in patients with DLM after chemotherapy.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic search for articles assessing the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in evaluating DLM following chemotherapy. True complete response was defined as 1-year recurrence-free survival in non-resected patients or complete pathological response on histologic examination in resected patients. We calculated the negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting true complete response of each imaging modality using a random effects model.

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies comprising 332 patients with at least one DLM were included. The number of DLMs after chemotherapy was 955 withÂ computed tomography (CT), 104 withÂ positron emission tomography (PET), 50Â with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), 585Â with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 175 withÂ contrast-enhanced IOUS (CEIOUS). Substantial variation in study design, patient characteristics, and imaging features was observed. Pooled NPV was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.96), 0.73 (95% CI 0.58-0.85), 0.54 (95% CI 0.37-0.7), 0.47 (95% CI 0.34-0.61), and 0.22 (95% CI 0.11-0.39) for CEIOUS, MRI, IOUS, CT, and PET, respectively.

CONCLUSION:
After chemotherapy, MRI or CEIOUS are the most accurate imaging modalities for assessment of DLM and should be used routinely in this context.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Can magnetic resonance imaging enhance the assessment of potential new treatments for cognitive impairment in mood disorders? A systematic review and position paper by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Targeting Cognition Task Force.,"BACKGROUND:
Developing treatments for cognitive impairment is key to improving the functioning of people with mood disorders. Neuroimaging may assist in identifying brain-based efficacy markers. This systematic review and position paper by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Targeting Cognition Task Force examines the evidence from neuroimaging studies of pro-cognitive interventions.

METHODS:
We included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of candidate interventions in people with mood disorders or healthy individuals, following the procedures of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 statement. Searches were conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 30th April 2021. Two independent authors reviewed the studies using the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Controlled Intervention Studies and the quality of neuroimaging methodology assessment checklist.

RESULTS:
We identified 26 studies (NÂ =Â 702). Six investigated cognitive remediation or pharmacological treatments in mood disorders (NÂ =Â 190). In healthy individuals, 14 studies investigated pharmacological interventions (NÂ =Â 319), 2 cognitive training (NÂ =Â 73) and 4 neuromodulatory treatments (NÂ =Â 120). Methodologies were mostly rated as 'fair'. 77% of studies investigated effects with task-based fMRI. Findings varied but most consistently involved treatment-associated cognitive control network (CCN) activity increases with cognitive improvements, or CCN activity decreases with no cognitive change, and increased functional connectivity. In mood disorders, treatment-related default mode network suppression occurred.

CONCLUSIONS:
Modulation of CCN and DMN activity is a putative efficacy biomarker. Methodological recommendations are to pre-declare intended analyses and use task-based fMRI, paradigms probing the CCN, longitudinal assessments, mock scanning, and out-of-scanner tests.",Developing treatments for cognitive impairment is key to improving the functioning of people with mood disorders.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Fetal periventricular pseudocysts: is MRI evaluation needed? What is the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with periventricular pseudocysts (PVPC) and the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these fetuses via meta-analysis.

METHODS:
MEDLINE and EMBASE database were searched for studies reporting on the MRI assessment of fetuses diagnosed with PVPC on neurosonography. The neurosonography was conducted according to the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) guidelines or standard axial, coronal and sagittal planes for advanced central nervous system (CNS) assessment. Single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences of MRI technique in three orthogonal planes were necessarily performed. The pooled proportion of CNS anomalies missed on neurosonography and detected only at prenatal MRI was calculated. Subanalysis was performed according to the types of intracranial anomalies. The pregnancy outcomes (including normal, abnormal, termination of pregnancy, and perinatal death) of PVPC fetuses were also analyzed.

RESULTS:
Five studies comprising 136 fetuses were included in this meta-analysis. Mean gestational age was 29.8Â weeks (16-38Â weeks) at ultrasonography and 31.5Â weeks (25-37Â weeks) at MRI. Overall, MRI detected exclusively CNS anomalies in 25.2% (95% CI 15.9-35.8%) of cases. Among them, the highest incidence was white matter abnormalities with the pooled proportion of 16.3% (95% CI 9.7-24.2%). When getting rid of whiteÂ matter abnormalities, the risk of associated CNS anomalies only detected on MRI was reduced to 9.1% (95% CI 1.8-21.4%). Meanwhile, 130 cases were studied to assess the pregnancy outcomes with the scope of 1Â month to 10Â years. The pooled proportion of normal outcomes in isolated PVPC fetuses was as high as 95.0% (95% CI 83.9-99.8%). When analyzing the neurodevelopmental outcomes in non-isolated PVPC fetuses, the incidence of normal neurodevelopmental outcomes was about 22.1% (95% CI 5.6-45.5%) with mild and single additional abnormalities, the rate of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes was 19.5% (95% CI 11.0-29.7%) with apparent and/or multiple abnormalities. Besides, 53.6% (95% CI 35.4-71.3%) of non-isolated PVPC cases were terminated mainly due to infections, genetic anomalies, metabolic disorders and hemorrhage.

CONCLUSIONS:
MRI assessment of PVPC fetuses is recommended to detect associated intracranial anomalies that may be missed on dedicated neurosonography. White matter abnormalities on MRI account for the majority of additional anomalies, which might to be the clue of CMV infection, aminoacidopathy or white matter disease. Moreover, the neurodevelopmental outcome of isolated PVPC fetuses remains favorable, while the neurodevelopmental outcomes of non-isolated PVPC fetuses depend on the accompanying anomaly.",To explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with periventricular pseudocysts (PVPC) and the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these fetuses via meta-analysis.,"MEDLINE and EMBASE database were searched for studies reporting on the MRI assessment of fetuses diagnosed with PVPC on neurosonography.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Does Femoral Intercondylar Notch Volume Differ in Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Injured Adult Patients Compared to the Uninjured?: A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Stenotic femoral intercondylar notch is considered as a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and three-dimensional notch volume is used as a marker for the injury. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the difference in notch volume between the ACL-injured and uninjured in men and women combined or stratified by sex. The secondary purpose was to assess the difference in notch volume between the ACL-intact men and women.

METHODS:
A search of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases from inception to December 9, 2020, was conducted without restrictions using the following terms: ACL, notch, volume, notch volume, femoral notch volume, and intercondylar notch volume. Studies that compared the ACL-injured with uninjured controls were included. Independent extraction of articles by two authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators was done. All pooled analyses were based on the inverse-variance weighted random effects model and mean difference was chosen as the effect measure.

RESULTS:
Nine studies (1,169 knees) qualified for overall analysis (both sexes combined) and significant heterogeneity was observed, which disappeared after pooling studies with age-sex matched controls and those without. Notch volume in the ACL-injured was 0.75 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.96 cm<sup>3</sup>), which was smaller than that in the age- and sex-matched controls. Six studies qualified for analysis in men. Notch volume in the ACL-injured men was smaller, especially when non-contact ACL injury was considered (1.40 cm<sup>3</sup>; 95% CI, 1.08-1.73 cm<sup>3</sup>). Five studies qualified for analysis in women and ACL-injured women had smaller notch volume irrespective of the mechanism of injury (0.38 cm<sup>3</sup>; 95% CI, 0.18-0.59 cm<sup>3</sup>). Notch volume of the uninjured men was larger than that of the uninjured women (1.86 cm<sup>3</sup>; 95% CI, 1.54-2.18 cm<sup>3</sup>).

CONCLUSIONS:

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,A meta-analysis on neural changes of cognitive training for mental disorders in executive function tasks: increase or decrease brain activation?,"BACKGROUND:
Cognitive impairment is often found in patients with psychiatric disorders, and cognitive training (CT) has been shown to help these patients. To better understand the mechanisms of CT, many neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural changes associated with it. However, the results of those studies have been inconsistent, making it difficult to draw conclusions from the literature. Therefore, the objective of this meta-analysis was to identify consistent patterns in the literature of neural changes associated with CT for psychiatric disorders.

METHODS:
We searched for cognitive training imaging studies in PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus, and ProQuest electronic databases. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, conduct behavioral analysis of brain regions identified by ALE analysis, conduct behavioral analysis of brain regions identified by ALE analysis, and then created a functional meta-analytic connectivity model (fMACM) of the resulting regions.

RESULTS:
Results showed that CT studies consistently reported increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and decreased activation in the left precuneus and cuneus from pre- to post- CT.

CONCLUSION:
CT improves cognitive function by supporting language and memory function, and reducing neuronal resources associated with basic visual processing.","Cognitive impairment is often found in patients with psychiatric disorders, and cognitive training (CT) has been shown to help these patients.

diagnostic radiology,magnetic resonance imaging,Is radiomic MRI a feasible alternative to OncotypeDXÂ® recurrence score testing? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
OncotypeDXÂ® recurrence score (RS) aids therapeutic decision-making in oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Radiomics is an evolving field that aims to examine the relationship between radiological features and the underlying genomic landscape of disease processes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of current evidence evaluating the comparability of radiomics and RS.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing radiomic MRI tumour analyses and RS were identified. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) delineating low risk (RS less than 18) versus intermediate-high risk (equal to or greater than 18) and low-intermediate risk (RS less than 30) and high risk (RS greater than 30) were recorded. Log rate ratios (lnRR) and standard error were determined from AUC and 95 per cent confidence intervals.

RESULTS:
Nine studies including 1216 patients met inclusion criteria; the mean age at diagnosis was 52.9 years. Mean RS was 16 (range 0-75); 401 patients with RS less than 18, 287 patients with RS 18-30 and 100 patients with RS greater than 30.

diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Diagnostic capabilities of transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) to evaluate anal sphincter defect post obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS)? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
Endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) is the gold standard imaging investigation for evaluating the anal sphincter; unfortunately, it is not universally available in most obstetric units. This study aims to appraise the ability of transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) compared with 3D-EAUS as the gold standard to identify anal sphincter defects after primary repair of OASIS.

METHODS:
A systematic search of major databases to identify diagnostic accuracy of 3D-TPUS in evaluating anal sphincter defects. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were designed for this systematic review. The risk of bias and applicability concerns were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our eligibility criteria are patients with a history of primary repair of anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). They were followed up after the primary repair to detect the anal sphincter defect using 3D-TPUS vs. 3D-EAUS as a gold standard.

RESULTS:
Two eligible observational studies were included and assessed for risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool and showed a low risk of bias and a low risk of concerns. 3D-TPUS had various sensitivity to detect external anal sphincter defects in two studies; meanwhile, the specificity was around 67-70%. For detecting the internal anal sphincter defects, 3D-TPUS had low sensitivity but high specificity (93-94%).

CONCLUSION:
3D-TPUS had various sensitivity to detect external anal sphincter defects and low sensitivity to detect internal anal sphincter defects. On the other hand, 3D-TPUS had low specificity for detecting external anal sphincter defects and high specificity for detecting internal anal sphincter defects.","Endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) is the gold standard imaging investigation for evaluating the anal sphincter; unfortunately, it is not universally available in most obstetric units.

diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Which combination of different ultrasonography modalities is more appropriate to diagnose breast cancer?: A network meta-analysis (a PRISMA-compliant article).,"BACKGROUND:
Abundant amount of literature that analyze the various detection of different ultrasound methods, no comprehensive literature that investigates the diagnostic values of breast cancer (BC) by different ultrasonography modalities through a network meta-analysis (NMA) has been made available. Each imaging diagnostic examination has its own advantages and disadvantages, and any imaging examination is not enough to make an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Thus, this study aimed to compare diagnostic values among different ultrasonography modalities, including the information of 2-dimension, stiffness and blood flow, by a network meta-analysis in the hopes of understanding which imaging methods are better and which combination of different ultrasonography modalities is more appropriate to diagnose BC.

METHODS:
We made use of Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase in order to obtain literature and papers. The combination analysis of both direct and indirect evidence in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value(NPV) and accuracy was conducted so as to assess the odds ratios (ORs) and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values of the 8 different ultrasound methods.

RESULTS:
A total of 36 eligible diagnostic tests regarding 8 ultrasound methods were included in the study. According to this network meta-analysis, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4b exhibited higher specificity, PPV, and accuracy and lower sensitivity and NPV than BI-RADS 4a. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) had the highest sensitivity, PPV, NPV and accuracy and superb microvascular imaging (SMI) had the highest specificity among color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), power Doppler imaging(PDI), SMI and CEUS. There was no significant difference in diagnostic indexes between SMI and CEUS. Shear wave elastrography (SWE) had higher PPV and accuracy and lower sensitivity, specificity NPV than strain elastography (SE).

Studies reporting OR for associations between carotid plaque or intima-media thickness (cIMT) and dichotomised MMSE were meta-analysed. Publication bias of included studies was assessed.

RESULTS:
A total of 31 of 378 reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria; together they included 27 738 participants (age 35-95 years). Fifteen studies reported some evidence of a positive association between measures of atherosclerosis and poorer cognitive performance in either cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. The remaining 16 studies found no evidence of an association. Seven cross-sectional studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of three studies that assessed carotid plaque (n=3549) showed an association between the presence of plaque and impaired MMSE with pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 2.72 (0.85 to 4.59). An association between cIMT and impaired MMSE was reported in six studies (n=4443) with a pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 1.13 (1.04 to 1.22). Heterogeneity across studies was moderate to small (carotid plaque with MMSE, I<sup>2</sup>=40.9%; cIMT with MMSE, I<sup>2</sup>=4.9%). There was evidence of publication bias for carotid plaque studies (p=0.02), but not cIMT studies (p=0.2).

CONCLUSIONS:
There is some, limited cross-sectional evidence indicating an association between cIMT and poorer global cognitive function assessed with MMSE. Estimates of the association between plaques and poor cognition are too imprecise to draw firm conclusions and evidence from studies of longitudinal associations between carotid atherosclerosis and MMSE is limited.

diagnostic radiology,ultrasound imaging,Are patients recovering from Kawasaki disease at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Recent studies have suggested that Kawasaki disease (KD) may cause endothelial dysfunction, which can potentially induce atherosclerosis. However, there is still no consensus on the relationship between KD and atherosclerosis. This article aimed to determine whether patients with a history of KD may be at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis via a meta-analysis.

METHODS:
The PubMed, Embase, and SpringerLink databases were systematically searched. Studies on risk factors for atherosclerosis were included. A meta-analysis of case-control studies was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.

RESULTS:
Twenty studies were included with a total of 1684 subjects (990 patients after KD and 694 controls). The meta-analysis showed that the level of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03; Pâ=â0.005) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (95% CI: 0.00, 0.10; Pâ=â0.03) were significantly higher in patients after KD than controls, whereas flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) (95% CI: -â5.14, -â1.26; Pâ=â0.001) in patients after KD was significantly lower. There were no significant differences in total cholesterol (TC) (95% CI: -â0.13, 5.92; Pâ=â0.06), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (95% CI: -â0.65, 2.08; Pâ=â0.31), or triglycerides (TG) (95% CI: -â1.94, 8.03; Pâ=â0.23).

CONCLUSION:
Endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory processes may exist in patients with a history of KD, which are risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis.","Recent studies have suggested that Kawasaki disease (KD) may cause endothelial dysfunction, which can potentially induce atherosclerosis.

diagnostic radiology,nuclear medicine,What is the Accuracy of Nuclear Imaging in the Assessment of Periprosthetic Knee Infection? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
In the assessment of possible periprosthetic knee infection, various imaging modalities are used without consensus regarding the most accurate technique.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
To perform a meta-analysis to compare the accuracy of various applied imaging modalities in the assessment of periprosthetic knee infection.

METHODS:
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase<sup>Â®</sup> in accordance with the PRISMA and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) recommendations to identify clinical studies in which periprosthetic knee infection was investigated with different imaging modalities. The sensitivity and specificity of each imaging technique were determined and compared with the results of microbiologic and histologic analyses, intraoperative findings, and clinical followup of more than 6Â months. A total of 23 studies, published between 1990 and 2015, were included for meta-analysis, representing 1027 diagnostic images of symptomatic knee prostheses. Quality of the included studies showed low concerns regarding external validity, whereas internal validity indicated more concerns regarding the risk of bias. The most important concerns were found in the lack of uniform criteria for the diagnosis of a periprosthetic infection and the flow and timing of the included studies. Differences among techniques were tested at a probability less than 0.05 level. Where there was slight overlap of confidence intervals for two means, it is possible for the point estimates to be statistically different from one another at a probability less than 0.05. The z-test was used to statistically analyze differences in these situations.

RESULTS:
Bone scintigraphy was less specific than all other modalities tested (56%; 95% CI, 0.47-0.64; pÂ <Â 0.001), and leukocyte scintigraphy (77%; 95% CI, 0.69-0.85) was less specific than antigranulocyte scintigraphy (95%; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; pÂ <Â 0.001) or combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; pÂ <Â 0.001). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (84%; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90) was more specific than bone scintigraphy (56%; 95% CI, 0.47-0.64; pÂ <Â 0.001), and less specific than antigranulocyte scintigraphy (95%; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; pÂ =Â 0.02) and combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; pÂ <Â 0.001). Leukocyte scintigraphy (88%; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; pÂ =Â 0.01) and antigranulocyte scintigraphy (90%; 95% CI, 0.78-0.96; pÂ =Â 0.02) were more sensitive than FGD-PET (70%; 95% CI, 0.56-0.81). However, because of broad overlapping of confidence intervals, no differences in sensitivity were observed among the other modalities, including combined bone scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98) or combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (80%; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91; pÂ >Â 0.05 for all paired comparisons).

CONCLUSIONS:
Based on current evidence, antigranulocyte scintigraphy and combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy appear to be highly specific imaging modalities in confirming periprosthetic knee infection. Bone scintigraphy was a highly sensitive imaging technique but lacks the specificity needed to differentiate among various conditions that cause painful knee prostheses. FDG-PET may not be the preferred imaging modality because it is more expensive and not more effective in confirming periprosthetic knee infection.

diagnostic radiology,mammography,Is single reading with computer-aided detection (CAD) as good as double reading in mammography screening? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
In accordance with European guidelines, mammography screening comprises independent readings by two breast radiologists (double reading). CAD (computer-aided detection) has been suggested to complement or replace one of the two readers (single readingâ+âCAD).The aim of this systematic review is to address the following question: Is the reading of mammographic x-ray images by a single breast radiologist together with CAD at least as accurate as double reading?

METHODS:
The electronic literature search included the databases Pub Med, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers assessed abstracts and full-text articles.

RESULTS:
1049 abstracts were identified, of which 996 were excluded with reference to inclusion and exclusion criteria; 53 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, four articles were included in the qualitative analysis, and one in a GRADE synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS:
The scientific evidence is insufficient to determine whether the accuracy of single readingâ+âCAD is at least equivalent to that obtained in standard practice, i.e. double reading where two breast radiologists independently read the mammographic images.","In accordance with European guidelines, mammography screening comprises independent readings by two breast radiologists (double reading).

diagnostic radiology,fluoroscopy,Does less invasive spine surgery result in increased radiation exposure? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Radiation exposure to patients and spine surgeons during spine surgery is expected. The risks of radiation exposure include thyroid cancer, cataracts, and lymphoma. Although imaging techniques facilitate less invasive approaches and improve intraoperative accuracy, they may increase radiation exposure.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
We performed a systematic review to determine whether (1) radiation exposure differs in open spine procedures compared with less invasive spine procedures; (2) radiation exposure differs in where the surgeon is positioned in relation to the C-arm; and (3) if radiation exposure differs using standard C-arm fluoroscopy or fluoroscopy with computer-assisted navigation.

METHODS:
A PubMed search was performed from January 1980 to July 2013 for English language articles relating to radiation exposure in spine surgery. Twenty-two relevant articles met inclusion criteria. Level of evidence was assigned on clinical studies. Traditional study quality evaluation of nonclinical studies was not applicable.

RESULTS:
There are important risks of radiation exposure in spine surgery to both the surgeon and patient. There is increased radiation exposure in less invasive spine procedures, but the use of protective barriers decreases radiation exposure. Where the surgeon stands in relation to the image source is important. Increasing the distance between the location of the C-arm radiation source and the surgeon, and standing contralateral from the C-arm radiation source, decreases radiation exposure. The use of advanced imaging modalities such as CT or three-dimensional computer-assisted navigation can potentially decrease radiation exposure.

CONCLUSIONS:
There is increased radiation exposure during less invasive spine surgery, which affects the surgeon, patient, and operating room personnel. Being cognizant of radiation exposure risks, the spine surgeon can potentially minimize radiation risks by optimizing variables such as the use of barriers, knowledge of position, distance from the radiation source, and use of advanced image guidance navigation-assisted technology to minimize radiation exposure. Continued research is important to study the long-term risk of radiation exposure and its relationship to cancer, which remains a major concern and needs further study as the popularity of less invasive spine surgery increases.","Radiation exposure to patients and spine surgeons during spine surgery is expected.

diagnostic radiology,fluoroscopy,Do Epidural Injections Provide Short- and Long-term Relief for Lumbar Disc Herniation? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
As part of a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, epidural injections often are used in the management of lumbar disc herniation. Recent guidelines and systematic reviews have reached different conclusions about the efficacy of epidural injections in managing lumbar disc herniation.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review, we determined the efficacy (pain relief and functional improvement) of the three anatomic approaches (caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal) for epidural injections in the treatment of disc herniation.

METHODS:
We performed a literature search from 1966 to June 2013 in PubMed, Cochrane library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, previous systematic reviews, and cross-references for trials studying all types of epidural injections in managing chronic or chronic and subacute lumbar disc herniation. We wanted only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (either placebo or active controlled) to be included in our analysis, and 66 studies found in our search fulfilled these criteria. We then assessed the methodologic quality of these 66 studies using the Cochrane review criteria for RCTs. Thirty-nine studies were excluded, leaving 23 RCTs of high and moderate methodologic quality for analysis. Evidence for the efficacy of all three approaches for epidural injection under fluoroscopy was strong for short-term (<Â 6Â months) and moderate for long-term (â¥Â 6Â months) based on the Cochrane rating system with five levels of evidence (best evidence synthesis), with strong evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple high-quality RCTs and moderate evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple low-quality RCTs or one high-quality RCT. The primary outcome measure was pain relief, defined as at least 50% improvement in pain or 3-point improvement in pain scores in at least 50% of the patients. The secondary outcome measure was functional improvement, defined as 50% reduction in disability or 30% reduction in the disability scores.

RESULTS:
Based on strong evidence for short-term efficacy from multiple high-quality trials and moderate evidence for long-term efficacy from at least one high quality trial, we found that fluoroscopic caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections were efficacious at managing lumbar disc herniation in terms of pain relief and functional improvement.

CONCLUSIONS:
The available evidence suggests that epidural injections performed under fluoroscopy by trained physicians offer improvement in pain and function in well-selected patients with lumbar disc herniation.","As part of a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, epidural injections often are used in the management of lumbar disc herniation.

diagnostic radiology,musculoskeletal radiology,Does Artificial Intelligence Outperform Natural Intelligence in Interpreting Musculoskeletal Radiological Studies? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that enables computers to abstract patterns from data without explicit programming. A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
This systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

RESULTS:
ML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p < 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p < 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images.

CONCLUSIONS:
At present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.

diagnostic radiology,musculoskeletal radiology,What Are the Prognostic Factors for Radiographic Progression of Knee Osteoarthritis? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A previous systematic review on prognostic factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression showed associations for generalized OA and hyaluronic acid levels. Knee pain, radiographic severity, sex, quadriceps strength, knee injury, and regular sport activities were not associated. It has been a decade since the literature search of that review and many studies have been performed since then investigating prognostic factors for radiographic knee OA progression.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
The purpose of this study is to provide an updated systematic review of available evidence regarding prognostic factors for radiographic knee OA progression.

METHODS:
We searched for observational studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Key words were: knee, osteoarthritis (or arthritis, or arthrosis, or degenerative joint disease), progression (or prognosis, or precipitate, or predictive), and case-control (or cohort, or longitudinal, or follow-up). Studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed for methodologic quality according to established criteria for reviews on prognostic factors in musculoskeletal disorders. Data were extracted and results were pooled if possible or summarized according to a best-evidence synthesis. A total of 1912 additional articles were identified; 43 met our inclusion criteria. The previous review contained 36 articles, thus providing a new total of 79 articles. Seventy-two of the included articles were scored high quality, the remaining seven were low quality.

RESULTS:
The pooled odds ratio (OR) of two determinants showed associations with knee OA progression: baseline knee pain (OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.74-3.27) and Heberden nodes (OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.46-8.84]). Our best-evidence synthesis showed strong evidence that varus alignment, serum hyaluronic acid, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± are associated with knee OA progression. There is strong evidence that sex, former knee injury, quadriceps strength, smoking, running, and regular performance of sports are not associated with knee OA progression. Evidence for the majority of determined associations, however, was limited, conflicting, or inconclusive.

CONCLUSIONS:
Baseline knee pain, presence of Heberden nodes, varus alignment, and high levels of serum markers hyaluronic acid and tumor necrosis factor-Î± predict knee OA progression. Sex, knee injury, and quadriceps strength, among others, did not predict knee OA progression. Large variation remains in definitions of knee OA and knee OA progression. Clinical studies should use more consistent definitions of these factors to facilitate data pooling by future meta-analyses.","A previous systematic review on prognostic factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression showed associations for generalized OA and hyaluronic acid levels.

diagnostic radiology,abdominal radiology,Is contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) superior to computed tomography angiography (CTA) in detection of endoleaks in post-EVAR patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the detection of endoleaks within endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) surveillance at time of follow up.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search was undertaken among the four major databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Ovid) to identify all articles assessing diagnostic specificity and accuracy with comparative modality (CEUS vs CTA) for endoleaks in adult patients at time of follow-up following EVAR. Databases where evaluated and assessed to October 2018.

RESULTS:
A total of 1773 patients were analysed from across 18 included studies in the quantitative analysis of the parameters of interest. There was no significant difference in detection rate of endoleak type I with detection rate 4.3% for both groups OR 1.09, 95% CI [0.78, 1.53], pâ=â0.62; type II endoleak detection rate was 22% in the CEUS group vs 23% in the CTA group OR 1.16, 95% CI [0.75-1.79], pâ=â0.50; while type III detection rate was 1.8% in CEUS group vs 2% in CTA group OR 0.85, 95% CI [0.43, 1.68], pâ=â0.64. However, the sensitivity rate for endoleak detection was higher in CEUS (pâ=â0.001) while no difference in specificity rate was noted (pâ=â0.28). There was higher rate of missed endoleaks in CTA groups (nâ=â12 vs nâ=â20).

CONCLUSION:
Evidences from this study suggest that contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan post-EVAR can be utilised as safe and effective method in screening for endoleaks during post-EVAR surveillance without exposing the patient for additional risk of radiation and contrast.

diagnostic radiology,abdominal radiology,Malpractice in invasive cardiology: is angiography of abdominal aorta or subclavian artery appropriate in patients undergoing coronary angiography? A meta analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Identification of peripheral vascular disease by angiography in patients undergoing coronary angiography may be considered as malpractice but sometimes seems to be justified under clear entry criteria. The present mata-analysis is aimed to analyze the appropriateness and results of screening angiography of subclavian or abdominal aorta performed at the time of coronary angiography.

METHODS:
A search of published literature for peripheral angiography in patients undergoing coronary angiography over the last 10 years was performed using the MEDLINE database. No language restriction was employed. Only studies enrolling more than 100 patients for abdominal aortography and 50 patients for subclavian/internal mammary artery angiography were considered. Reference lists from identified studies were also reviewed to identify other potentially relevant references.

RESULTS:
Twenty-nine studies were retrieved: 8 articles about subclavian artery (SA) and internal mammary (IMA) angiography and 21 about renal (RA) and aortoiliac (AOI) angiography. The total number of patients enrolled was 27,936. Nine studies out of 29 were prospective. Defined entry criteria were reported in 24 out of 29 studies. Significant SA and IMA stenosis were reported in 5.5 and 9% of patients, respectively. RA stenosis >50% was present in 12.7% of patients with CAD. Finally, undetected AOI disease was reported in 35.5% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Mean complication rate was 0.8 +/- 0.6%. Predictors of SA and IMA stenosis were unclear. Age, multi-risk profile, multi-vessel CAD, history of PVD or carotid disease, severe hypertension, unexplained renal dysfunction or decreased creatinine clearance have been reported most frequently as predictors of RA and AOI disease in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

CONCLUSIONS:
Consistent evidence of appropriateness of renal angiography in selected patients undergoing coronary angiography have been produced in literature.

emergency medicine,adult orthopedics,How Satisfied Are Patients and Surgeons with Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a rapid pivot toward telemedicine owing to closure of in-person elective clinics and sustained efforts at physical distancing worldwide. Throughout this period, there has been revived enthusiasm for delivering and receiving orthopaedic care remotely. Unfortunately, rapidly published editorials and commentaries during the pandemic have not adequately conveyed findings of published randomized trials on this topic.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What are the levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction with the use of telemedicine as a tool for orthopaedic care delivery? (2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits?

METHODS:
In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine, and secondary objectives to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes and time commitment. We used combinations of search keywords and medical subject headings around the terms ""telemedicine"", ""telehealth"", and ""virtual care"" combined with ""orthopaedic"", ""orthopaedic surgery"" and ""randomized."" We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments. Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study. Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded. Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors). We screened 133 published articles; 12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups). Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials).

RESULTS:
There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.40 to 1.99]; p = 0.79). There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.07 to 2.19]; p = 0.28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function. Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32]; p = 0.03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281]; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:
Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments. Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses. Future studies must be adequately powered to detect these differences to ensure patient safety is not compromised with the use of telemedicine. Although telemedicine may lead to a similar patient experience, surgeons should maintain a low threshold for follow-up with in-person assessments whenever possible in the absence of further safety data.

We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments. Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study. Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded. Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors). We screened 133 published articles; 12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups). Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials).","There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.40 to 1.99]; p = 0.79). There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.07 to 2.19]; p = 0.28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function. Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32]; p = 0.03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281]; p < 0.001).","Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments. Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses.

emergency medicine,adult orthopedics,Are Virtual Fracture Clinics During the COVID-19 Pandemic a Potential Alternative for Delivering Fracture Care? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Virtual fracture clinics are an alternative to the traditional model of fracture care. Since their introduction in 2011, they have become increasingly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis has driven institutions to examine such innovative solutions to manage patient care. The current controversies include quantifying safety outcomes, such as potential delayed or missed injuries, inadequate treatment, and medicolegal claims. Questions also exist regarding the potential for cost reductions and efficiencies that may be achieved. Physical distancing has limited the number of face-to-face consultations, so this review was conducted to determine if virtual fracture clinics can provide an acceptable alternative in these challenging times.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
The aim of this systematic review was to describe (1) adverse outcomes, (2) cost reductions, and (3) efficiencies associated with the virtual fracture clinic model.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted from database inception to March 2020. The keywords ""virtual"" or ""telemedicine"" or ""telehealth"" or ""remote"" or ""electronic"" AND ""fracture"" or ""trauma"" or ""triage"" AND ""clinic"" or ""consultation"" were entered, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria included adults and children treated for injuries by a virtual clinic model at the initial review. Eligible injuries included injuries deemed to not need surgical intervention, and those able to be treated remotely using defined protocols. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients reviewed by telemedicine using video links or in person at the initial review. Initially, 1065 articles were identified, with 665 excluded as they did not relate to virtual fracture clinics. In all, 400 articles were screened for eligibility, and 27 full-text reviews were conducted on 18 studies (30,512 virtual fracture clinic encounters). Three subdomains focusing on adverse outcomes, cost reductions, and efficiencies were recorded. The term adverse outcomes was used to describe any complications, further surgeries, re-referrals back to the clinic, or deviations from the protocols. Efficiency described the number of patients reviewed and discharged using the model, savings in clinic slots, reduced waiting times, or a reduction in consumption of resources such as radiographs. All studies were observational and the quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool, which demonstrated a median score of 6 Â± 1.8, indicating moderate quality.

RESULTS:
Six studies reported adverse outcomes in detail, with events ranging from inappropriate splinting, deviations from protocols, and one patient underwent an osteotomy for a malunion. Efficiency varied from direct discharge proportions of 18% in early studies to 100% once the virtual fracture clinic model was more established. Cost reductions compared with estimates derived from conventional fracture clinics varied from USD 53 to USD 297 and USD 39,125 to USD 305876 compared with traditional fracture clinic visits.

CONCLUSIONS:
Virtual fracture clinics may provide a means to treat patients remotely, using agreed-upon protocols. They have an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to the possibility to provide ongoing care in an otherwise challenging setting. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long-term effects on patients, institutions, and health care systems.

emergency medicine,adult orthopedics,Which is the optimal orthogeriatric care model to prevent mortality of elderly subjects post hip fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis based on current clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND:
While there is a general consensus of the impact of an orthogeriatric organisation in terms of elderly patient mortality post hip fracture, it is unclear which, among these various care models, is the most optimal.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using the keywords ""Femoral fractures or total hip replacements or Accidental, falls"" and ""Aged, 80 and over"" and ""Mortality"". The review is presented following PRISMA guidance.

RESULTS:
Eighteen studies were identified, published between 1988 and 2015. The number of elderly subjects participating in these studies was between 37 and 951; their mean age was 82.6âÂ±â7.4Â years, and average mortality in these studies was 17.7%. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI for association between implementation of the orthogeriatric model and mortality in all patients studied were 0.85 (0.74-0.97). In the analysis by subgroup on the type of orthogeriatric model, the group ""Orthogeriatric ward"" gave homogenous results, with ORs and 95% CIs of 0.62 (0.48-0.80) unlike other models: ""Shared care by orthopaedists and geriatricians ""and ""Geriatric advice in orthopaedic ward"".

CONCLUSIONS:
Elderly patients with hip fracture admitted early into any sort of orthogeriatric models or more specifically to a dedicated orthogeriatric ward had reduced long-term mortality. This study has to be completed by RCT showing the efficacy of orthogeriatric ward compared to other models using outcomes such as quality of life or functional recovery.","While there is a general consensus of the impact of an orthogeriatric organisation in terms of elderly patient mortality post hip fracture, it is unclear which, among these various care models, is the most optimal.","A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using the keywords ""Femoral fractures or total hip replacements or Accidental, falls"" and ""Aged, 80 and over"" and ""Mortality"".

emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,Is body mass index associated with outcomes of mechanically ventilated adult patients in intensive critical units? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity paradox refers to lower mortality in subjects with higher body mass index (BMI), and has been documented under a variety of condition. However, whether obesity paradox exists in adults requiring mechanical ventilation in intensive critical units (ICU) remains controversial.

METHODS:
MEDLINE, EMBASE, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) and CINAHL electronic databases were searched from the earliest available date to July 2017, using the following search terms: ""body weight"", ""body mass index"", ""overweight"" or ""obesity"" and ""ventilator"", ""mechanically ventilated"", ""mechanical ventilation"", without language restriction. Subjects were divided into the following categories based on BMI (kg/m2): underweight, < 18.5 kg/m2; normal, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2; overweight, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2; obese, 30-39.9 kg/m2; and severely obese > 40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was mortality, and included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, short-term mortality (<6 months), and long-term mortality (6 months or beyond). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital. A random-effects model was used for data analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.

RESULTS:
A total of 15,729 articles were screened. The final analysis included 23 articles (199,421 subjects). In comparison to non-obese patients, obese patients had lower ICU mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.0.84-0.92, I2 = 0%), hospital mortality (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93, I2 = 52%), short-term mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.88, I2 = 0%) as well as long-term mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79, I2 = 0%). In comparison to subjects with normal BMI, obese patients had lower ICU mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.93, I2 = 5%). Hospital mortality was lower in severely obese and obese subjects (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.94, I2 = 74%, and OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.89, I2 = 30%). Short-term mortality was lower in overweight and obese subjects (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.90, I2 = 0%, and, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.84, I2 = 8%, respectively). Long-term mortality was lower in severely obese, obese and overweight subjects (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.83, and OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86, I2 = 56%, and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.77, I2 = 0%). All 4 mortality measures were higher in underweight subjects than in subjects with normal BMI. Obese subjects had significantly longer duration on mechanical ventilation than non-obese group (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.16-0.80, I2 = 37%), In comparison to subjects with normal BMI, severely obese BMI had significantly longer time in mechanical ventilation (MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.38-1.83, I2 = 47%). Hospital LOS did not differ between obese and non-obese patients (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.50, I2 = 80%). Obese patients had longer ICU LOS than non-obese patients (MD 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.59, I2 = 70%). Hospital LOS and ICU LOS did not differ significantly in subjects with different BMI status.

emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders,' (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment.

METHODS:
Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment.

RESULTS:
A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9-62.7) where <500Â ml was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9-61.0) where 500Â ml was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9-79.2) where >500Â ml was administered (pâ=â0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for <15Â minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2-64.1) and for 15-30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4-62.4, pâ=â1). Where the infusion time was â¥30Â minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6-54, pâ=â0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10Â minutes, and >10Â minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (pâ=â0.47).

CONCLUSIONS:
The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.","The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness.

emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,Does pre-hospital endotracheal intubation improve survival in adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is currently considered superior to supraglottic airway devices (SGA) for survival and other outcomes among adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We aimed to determine if the research supports this conclusion by conducting a systematic review.

METHODS:
We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL databases for studies published between January 1, 1980, and 30 April 30, 2013, which compared pre-hospital use of ETI with SGA for outcomes of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); survival to hospital admission; survival to hospital discharge; and favorable neurological or functional status. We selected studies using pre-specified criteria. Included studies were independently screened for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We did not pool results because of study variability. Study outcomes were extracted and results presented as summed odds ratios with 95% CI.

RESULTS:
We identified five eligible studies: one quasi-randomized controlled trial and four cohort studies, involving 303,348 patients in total. Only three of the five studies reported a higher proportion of ROSC with ETI versus SGA with no difference reported in the remaining two. None found significant differences between ETI and SGA for survival to hospital admission or discharge. One study reported better functional status at discharge for ETI versus SGA. Two studies reported no significant difference for favorable neurological status between ETI and SGA.

CONCLUSION:
Current evidence does not conclusively support the superiority of ETI over SGA for multiple outcomes among adults with OHCA.",Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is currently considered superior to supraglottic airway devices (SGA) for survival and other outcomes among adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

emergency medicine,adult resuscitation,Is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation more effective and safer than conventional protective ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"INTRODUCTION:
Comprehensively evaluating the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is important to allow clinicians who are using or considering this intervention to make appropriate decisions.

METHODS:
To find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFOV with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) as an initial treatment for adult ARDS patients, we searched electronic databases (including PubMed, MedLine, Springer Link, Elsevier Science Direct, ISI web of knowledge, and EMBASE) with the following terms: ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"", ""acute lung injury"", and ""high frequency oscillation ventilation"". Additional sources included reference lists from the identified primary studies and relevant meta-analyses. Two investigators independently screened articles and extracted data. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models.

RESULTS:
We included 6 RCTs with a total of 1,608 patients in this meta-analysis. Compared with CMV, HFOV did not significantly reduce the mortality at 30 or 28Â days. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.051 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.813 to 1.358). ICU mortality was also not significantly reduced in HFOV group, with a pooled RR of 1.218 (95% CI 0.925 to 1.604). The pooled effect sizes of HFOV for oxygenation failure, ventilation failure and duration of mechanical ventilation were 0.557 (95% CI 0.351 to 0.884), 0.892 (95% CI 0.435 to 1.829) and 0.079 (95% CI -0.045 to 0.203), respectively. The risk of barotrauma and hypotension were similar between the CMV group and HFOV group, with a RR of 1.205 (95% CI 0.834 to 1.742) and a RR of 1.326 (95% CI 0.271 to 6.476), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:
Although HFOV seems not to increase the risk of barotrauma or hypotension, and reduces the risk of oxygenation failure, it does not improve survival in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.",Comprehensively evaluating the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is important to allow clinicians who are using or considering this intervention to make appropriate decisions.,"To find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFOV with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) as an initial treatment for adult ARDS patients, we searched electronic databases (including PubMed, MedLine, Springer Link, Elsevier Science Direct, ISI web of knowledge, and EMBASE) with the following terms: ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"", ""acute lung injury"", and ""high frequency oscillation ventilation"".

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Is obesity associated with taste alterations? a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity is a growing chronic public health problem. The causes of obesity are varied, but food consumption decisions play an important role, especially decisions about what foods to eat and how much to consume. Food consumption decisions are driven, in part, by individual taste perceptions, a fact that can influence eating behavior and, therefore, body mass.

METHODOLOGY:
The searches were conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, and the grey literature (Google Scholar and Open Grey). The acronym PECO will be used, covering studies with adult humans (P) who have obesity (E) compared to adult humans without obesity (C), having as an outcome the presence of taste alterations (O). After searching, duplicates were removed. The articles were first evaluated by title and abstract, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria; then, the papers were read in full. After the studies were selected, two reviewers extracted the data and assessed the individual risk of bias and control statements for possible confounders and bias consideration. The narrative GRADE system performed the methodological quality assessment using the New Castle Ottawa qualifier and analysis of certainty of evidence.

RESULTS:
A total of 3782 records were identified from the database search, of these 19 were considered eligible. Forty percent of the eligible studies show that there was an association between obesity and different taste alterations for different flavors comparing with normal weights adults. In the methodological quality analysis of the nineteen studies, which assesses the risk of bias in the results, fifteen showed good methodological reliability, three showed fair methodological reliability, and one showed low methodological reliability.

CONCLUSION:
Despite methodological limitations, the results of the studies suggest the existence of a association between obesity and taste alterations, but further investigations with more sensitive methodologies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Does Physical Exercise Enhance the Immune Response after Vaccination? A Systematic Review for Clinical Indications of COVID-19 Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND:
Stimulating protective immunity with vaccines appears to be the most promising option for providing widespread moderate to high protection against COVID-19 in people over the age of 18. Regular exercise improves the immune response, transmitting possible benefits against virus infections. The aim of this review is to study the effects of physical activity on vaccine injections, helping to develop new recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

METHODS:
A comprehensive review of the existing literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The internal quality of the studies was assessed according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The outcomes analyzed were antibody titer, the level of lymphocytes CD4, CD8, InterLeukin 6 (IL6), leukocytes level, the visual analogue scale (VAS) for overall pain rating, arm and forearm circumferences and volume of oxygen (VO2) peak.

RESULTS:
Fourteen articles were selected for the analysis. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) (<i>n</i> = 8) and controlled trials (CT) (<i>n</i> = 6). According to PEDro, the 'fair' category (<i>n</i> = 7) was the most represented, followed by 'good' (<i>n</i> = 6) and 'excellent' (<i>n</i> = 1). Physical training showed a positive effect on antibody titers of the vaccine; yet, different variables seem to influence antibody titers: higher new vs. old antigen in the vaccine, higher in younger vs. older individuals, and higher in females vs. males. After exercise, when analyzing variables of direct response to the vaccine, such as the amount of CD4, IL-6 and leukocytes, higher levels were observed in the patients who performed physical exercise compared to the control group. In the same way, better results were observed in physiological variables such as VO2 and limb circumferences, or subjective variables such as pain, which showed better results than the control group.

CONCLUSIONS:
The immune response (antibody titers) depends on age, gender and the intensity of physical activity: long-term protocols at moderate intensity are the most recommended. All of these aspects also have to be carefully considered for the COVID-19 vaccination.","Stimulating protective immunity with vaccines appears to be the most promising option for providing widespread moderate to high protection against COVID-19 in people over the age of 18.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,The effects of the addition of mechanical traction to physical therapy on low back pain? A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparative effects of different types or parameters of lumbar traction in low back pain (LBP).

METHODS:
CENTRAL, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, PEDro, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched from their inception to March 31, 2021. We considered all RCTs comparing different types or parameters of lumbar traction on adults who complained of LBP with or without lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Any restriction regarding publication time or language was applied. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, performed the quality assessment, and extracted the results. Meta-analysis employed a random-effects model.

RESULTS:
Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, and five were pooled. Meta-analyses of results from five studies on LBP with LR showed no significant difference between diverse tractions modalities at short-term follow-up. Very low to low-quality evidence supports these results. High-force and low-force traction demonstrated clinically significant improvements in pain.

CONCLUSION:
The literature suggests the short-term effectiveness of traction on pain in LBP with LR, regardless of the type or the dosage employed. Different effects of traction other the mechanical ones can be hypothesized. This systematic review may be relevant for clinical practice due to the similar effects of different traction types or dosages.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:
Level I, Therapeutic Study.",This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparative effects of different types or parameters of lumbar traction in low back pain (LBP).,"CENTRAL, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, PEDro, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched from their inception to March 31, 2021. We considered all RCTs comparing different types or parameters of lumbar traction on adults who complained of LBP with or without lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Any restriction regarding publication time or language was applied. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, performed the quality assessment, and extracted the results. Meta-analysis employed a random-effects model.","Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, and five were pooled.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Repair of rotator cuff tears in patients aged 75 years and older: Does it make sense? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Rotator cuff injuries are common, and morbidity increases with age. The asymptomatic full-thickness tear rate is 40% in the over 75-year-old population.

PURPOSE:
This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the outcomes of rotator cuff repair among >75 years old patients.

STUDY DESIGN:
Systematic review.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search was performed in the electronic databases of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Studies in English evaluating repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged >75 years were included.

RESULTS:
Six studies were reviewed, including 311 patients (313 shoulders) treated with arthroscopic and/or open rotator cuff repair. Sixty-one patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 252 shoulders with outcome data. Patients in this age group demonstrated a significant improvement in the clinical and functional scores after rotator cuff repair, with a high satisfaction rate. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 43.8 (range, 42.0-45.5) preoperatively to 85.3 (range, 84.0 to 86.5) postoperatively, and the mean Constant scores improved from 45.4 (range, 34.7-55.5) to 78.6 (range, 67.0-91.6). Pain, evaluated in all studies by the visual analog scale for pain, showed a significant improvement at the last follow-up compared with the mean preoperative score. Furthermore, range of motion and return to daily activities and sports gained marked improvements.

CONCLUSION:
Rotator cuff repair in patients aged >75 years could achieve high clinical success rates with good outcomes and pain relief. Although patients in this age group are at a high risk of retear, rotator cuff repair may offer a good option with significant functional and clinical improvement.","Rotator cuff injuries are common, and morbidity increases with age.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,Do psychological factors relate to movement-evoked pain in people with musculoskeletal pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the importance of implementing movement-evoked pain in conventional pain assessments, with a significant role for psychological factors being suggested. Whether or not to include these factors in the assessment of movement-evoked pain has not yet been determined.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim of this systematic review is to explore the association between psychological factors and movement-evoked pain scores in people with musculoskeletal pain.

METHODS:
For this systematic review with meta-analysis, four electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, WOS, and Scopus) were searched. Cross-sectional studies, longitudinal cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials investigating the association between movement-evoked pain and psychological factors in adults with musculoskeletal pain were considered. Meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes with homogeneous data from at least 2 studies. Fischer-Z transformations were used as the measure of effect. Quality of evidence was assessed using the National Institutes of Health's Quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

RESULTS:
Meta-analyses and grading the quality of evidence revealed moderate evidence for a relation between movement-evoked pain and depressive symptoms (Fisher-z=0.27; 95%CI: 0.17, 0.36; 5 studies (n=440)), pain-related fear (Fisher-z=0.35; 95%CI: 0.26, 0.44; 6 studies (n=492)), and pain catastrophizing (Fisher-z=0.47; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.58; 4 studies (n=312)) in people with musculoskeletal pain.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,How do predisposing factors differ between delirium motor subtypes? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospitalised older adults with vast negative consequences. The predominant method of subtyping delirium is by motor activity profile into hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed groups.

OBJECTIVE:
This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated how predisposing factors differ between delirium motor subtypes.

METHODS:
Databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) were systematically searched for studies reporting predisposing factors (prior to delirium) for delirium motor subtypes. A total of 61 studies met inclusion criteria (Nâ=â14,407, mean age 73.63Â years). Random-effects meta-analyses synthesised differences between delirium motor subtypes relative to 22 factors.

RESULTS:
Hypoactive cases were older, had poorer cognition and higher physical risk scores than hyperactive cases and were more likely to be women, living in care homes, taking more medications, with worse functional performance and history of cerebrovascular disease than all remaining subtypes. Hyperactive cases were younger than hypoactive and mixed subtypes and were more likely to be men, with better cognition and lower physical risk scores than all other subtypes. Those with no motor subtype (unable to be classified) were more likely to be women and have better functional performance. Effect sizes were small.

CONCLUSIONS:
Important differences in those who develop motor subtypes of delirium were shown prior to delirium occurrence. We provide robust quantitative evidence for a common clinical assumption that indices of frailty (institutional living, cognitive and functional impairment) are seen more in hypoactive patients. Motor subtypes should be measured across delirium research. Motor subtyping has great potential to improve the clinical risk assessment and management of delirium.",This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated how predisposing factors differ between delirium motor subtypes.,"Databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) were systematically searched for studies reporting predisposing factors (prior to delirium) for delirium motor subtypes.

emergency medicine,adult signs and symptoms,What psychological interventions are effective for the management of persistent physical symptoms (PPS)? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:
Presentation of persistent physical symptoms is associated with increased health care utilization, yet clinical outcomes often remain suboptimal. This systematic review aimed to determine whether psychological interventions are effective for the management of PPS and if so, what are the features of the interventions and at what level of care are they delivered. The review also set out to establish which symptoms in those diagnosed with PPS can be effectively managed with psychological intervention.

METHODS:
Studies were included if they clearly reported a psychological intervention, specified the study sample as adults with a diagnosis of persistent physical symptoms, included a comparator and as a minimum an outcome measure of somatic symptoms. Risk of bias was assessed using the EPHPP. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effect of interventions on somatic symptoms (the primary outcome), anxiety and depression (secondary outcomes).

RESULTS:
Seventeen papers of varying quality indicated that psychological interventions can be effective for the management of somatic symptoms reported by individuals with PPS within a primary care setting. Psychological interventions were also found to be effective at reducing depression symptoms in individuals with PPS in twelve of the included studies. However, the meta-analysis results suggest that the psychological interventions utilized within eleven of the included studies did not significantly impact anxiety symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS:
Psychological interventions have some success in managing somatic symptoms in PPS patients within primary care settings although their effects on other psychological symptoms is more mixed. The review highlights the importance of establishing a clearer diagnostic classification to inform treatment trajectories and the need for appropriate training and support within a multi-disciplinary team to enable the provision of such therapies.","Presentation of persistent physical symptoms is associated with increased health care utilization, yet clinical outcomes often remain suboptimal. This systematic review aimed to determine whether psychological interventions are effective for the management of PPS and if so, what are the features of the interventions and at what level of care are they delivered.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does kyphoplasty affect the global sagittal alignment in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are common in elderly patients and may cause local kyphosis due to the vertebral collapse and wedging. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) with polymethyl methacrylate is widely used to relieve back pain and restore the height and kyphosis of the destroyed vertebra Johnell (Osteoporos Int 17(12):1726-33, 2006); Wasnich (Bone 18: 179S-183S, 1996); Finnern (Osteoporos Int 14:429-436, 2003). However, the influence of BKP on global sagittal alignment (GSA) in patients with OVCF remains unclear.

OBJECTIVE:
To systematically evaluate the relevant literature regarding the influence of BKP on the global spinal sagittal alignment using the following radiological parameters: Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA) and Spinosacral Angle (SSA). Visual Analogue Score (VAS) was also recorded.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the English language literature dating up until August 2022, was undertaken utilising the PRISMA guidelines.

RESULTS:
Of a total of 548 articles, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria (4 level III evidence) and were analyzed. Overall, 201 patients of mean age 73.8Â years (69-77) had acute OVCF of one or more vertebra. The male to female ratio was 51:128. The number of fractured vertebrae was 235 (average of 1.17 fractured vertebrae per patient). Their pre-operative radiological parameters on standing x-rays showed a mean PI of 56Â°, PT 24.1Â°, LL 44.4Â°, TK 42.3Â°, PI-LL 11.7Â°, SVA 4.9Â cm, LL/TK 1 and SSA 114.8Â°. The average VAS was 7.6 (2.6-10). All the patients underwent BKP and their radiological parameters on standing x-rays post operatively showed a mean PI of 55.3Â°, PT 23.1Â°, LL 45.1Â°, TK 41.4Â°, PI-LL 10.3Â°, SVA 4.29Â cm, LL/TK 1.07 and SSA 116.8Â°. Their average VAS post BPK was 2.36 (0-4.8).A statistical analysis comparing the pre/post-operative GSA (111 patients, 3 studies with standard deviations) showed no statistical difference in PT (24.1Â° vs. 23.5Â°, Pâ=â0.93), TK (42.3Â° vs. 42.4Â°, Pâ=â0.57), PI-LL (14.4Â° vs.12.4Â°, Pâ=â0.4), SVA (6.1Â cm vs. 5.5Â cm, Pâ=â0.19) SSA (114.8Â° vs. 116.7Â° Pâ=â0.36). VAS was significantly reduced post BKP (7.1 vs. 2.5 Pâ=â0.004).

CONCLUSION:
Performing BKP procedures does not significantly affect the global sagittal alignment in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. There was however, a significant improvement in pain scores in patients undergoing BKP at 1 or more levels.","To systematically evaluate the relevant literature regarding the influence of BKP on the global spinal sagittal alignment using the following radiological parameters: Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA) and Spinosacral Angle (SSA).

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Are local analgesics effective in reducing autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury? A systematic review.,"STUDY DESIGN:
Systematic review.

OBJECTIVES:
To systematically review the evidence on the use of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine or bupivacaine, to prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during iatrogenic procedures or bowel and bladder care routines in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).

METHODS:
A keyword search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Cochrane Reviews, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases identified all English-language studies evaluating the efficacy of local analgesics in reducing AD. Included studies were either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Participants were adults with chronic SCI who received local analgesics prior to AD-triggering procedures or routines. Additionally, studies were required to report blood pressure values as an outcome. The methodology of this review followed the PRISMA checklist and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021219506).

RESULTS:
Four RCTs and two quasi-experimental studies met inclusion criteria. Results were narratively synthesized as meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity across studies included in the review. All six studies administered lidocaine. Lidocaine was found to have a beneficial effect on AD in three studies, no effect in two studies and a detrimental effect in one study.

CONCLUSIONS:
Presently, RCTs and quasi-experimental studies on the use of lidocaine for reducing AD in individuals with SCI had small sample sizes and opposing findings. There is a strong need for definitive, well-monitored clinical trials with adequate sample sizes. Presently there is not enough compelling evidence to support or refute recommendations for the use of lidocaine from the AD management clinical practice guidelines.","To systematically review the evidence on the use of local analgesics, specifically lidocaine or bupivacaine, to prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during iatrogenic procedures or bowel and bladder care routines in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).","A keyword search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Cochrane Reviews, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases identified all English-language studies evaluating the efficacy of local analgesics in reducing AD.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,What is the impact of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) plus calcium on the incidence of hip fracture in older people? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Hip fractures have a huge impact in reducing the quality of life and increasing mortality. This review aims to assess the impact of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 plus calcium on the incidence of hip fracture in people over 65âyears.

METHODS:
PRISMA guidelines were followed and RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of daily oral supplementation of vitamin D3 plus calcium in preventing hip fracture in adults over 65âyears were included in the study. The databases such as Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus were searched from October 2019- January 2020.The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to check the quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis with fixed effect model using Review Manager (Revman 5.3) was used to analyse the data.

RESULTS:
The meta-analysis of seven RCTs on vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation and hip fracture (nÂ =â12,620) identified odds ratio (OR) of 0.75; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.64, 0.87; pÂ =â.0003. Daily oral supplementation of 800 IU of Vitamin D3 plus 1200âmg of calcium was found more effective (nÂ =â5676 participants; ORÂ =Â 0.69; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82; pâ<â.0001) than daily oral supplementation of 800 IU of Vitamin D3 plus 1000 mg of calcium (nÂ =â6555,ORÂ =Â 1.08; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.56; pÂ =â.70) in reducing hip fracture. A meta-analysis of the seven RCTs to identify the incidence of non-vertebral fracture gave the OR of 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89; pÂ <â.0001. A meta-analysis of three RCTs on femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) (nÂ =â483) gave a mean difference of 1.21; 95% CI: -0.79, 3.20; pÂ =â.24.

CONCLUSION:
Daily oral supplementation 800âIU of vitamin D3 plus 1200âmg of calcium reduces hip fracture and non-vertebral fracture in older people. Administering vitamin D3 and calcium supplements had no effect in increasing the femoral neck BMD.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:
Even though it is evident from the review that optimal daily intake of vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation help in the prevention of fracture, it is only one essential element in fracture prevention. Also, people who are on dietary supplements should be compliant with same for better result. Efforts to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis should begin from an early age. It includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle, optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D3, proper nutrition, adequate exposure to sunlight, exercise etc. Proper education on healthy lifestyle, avoiding risk factors like smoking, caffeine, alcohol and awareness of bone health should continue throughout life with emphasis during menopause when increased bone loss is expected.",Hip fractures have a huge impact in reducing the quality of life and increasing mortality.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,What is the optimal surgical treatment for Neer type IIB (IIC) distal clavicle fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the current treatment strategies for the treatment of Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures in terms of functional outcome and complication rates and to examine the most appropriate surgical method by comparing all the available surgical techniques and implants.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic review of the existing literature (2000-2021) in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Research Gate and Google Scholar using the general terms 'distal AND clavicle AND fracture' to capture as many reports as possible. The MINORS tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the nonrandomized studies. We categorized the reported surgical techniques into four main types: open or arthroscopic coracoclavicular (CC) stabilization, locking plate fixation with or without CC augmentation, hook plate fixation and acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) transfixation. We reported findings for two main outcomes: clinical results and complication rates categorized into major and minor.

RESULTS:
Our database search yielded a total of 630 records; 34 studies were appropriate for qualitative analysis. There were 790 patients, with a mean age of 40.1Â years, a female percentage of 37% and a mean follow-up period of 29.3Â months. In total, 132 patients received a hook plate, 252 received a locking plate, 368 received CC stabilization and 41 received transacromial transfixation. All studies were retrospective and had fair MINORS scores. Locking plate, CC stabilization and ACJ transfixation showed similar clinical results but were much better than hook plate fixation; CC augmentation did not significantly improve the outcome of locking plate fixation. The rate of major complications was similar among groups; hook plate and AC joint transfixation had the worst rates of minor complications. Open CC techniques were slightly better than arthroscopic techniques.

CONCLUSIONS:
The present systematic review for the optimal fixation method for Neer type IIB fractures of the distal clavicle showed similar major complication rates among techniques; the hook plate technique demonstrated inferior clinical results to other techniques. Open CC stabilization and locking plate fixation without CC augmentation seem to be the best available treatment options.",The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the current treatment strategies for the treatment of Neer type IIB distal clavicle fractures in terms of functional outcome and complication rates and to examine the most appropriate surgical method by comparing all the available surgical techniques and implants.,"We performed a systematic review of the existing literature (2000-2021) in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Should Arthroscopic Bone Marrow Stimulation Be Used in the Management of Secondary Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common, particularly after trauma. Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation has emerged as the first-choice surgical treatment for small primary lesions less than 100 mm2. Individual studies on the topic are small and heterogeneous, and they have differed in their main findings; for this reason, systematically reviewing the available evidence seems important.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review, we asked: (1) What patient-reported outcomes and pain scores have been observed after arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus? (2) What complications were reported? (3) What demographic and clinical factors were reported to be associated with better patient-reported outcome scores?

METHODS:
We performed a systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using Embase, EmCare, PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus (databases last searched June 23, 2021). A two-stage title/abstract and full-text screening process was performed independently by two reviewers. Randomized control trials, cohort studies, and observational studies published in English that evaluated the outcome of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus were included. Case reports, review articles, commentaries, abstracts, and letters to the editor were excluded. A total of 12 articles (10 case series and two retrospective comparative studies) involving 446 patients were included. Of these, 111 patients with a mean age of 33 years (range 20 to 49) received arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for a secondary osteochondral lesion of the talus. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria were used to assess the methodologic quality of included studies. The MINORS is a numerical score ranging from 0 to 16 for studies with no comparison group and 0 to 24 for comparative studies, with higher quality studies receiving higher scores. Of the 10 noncomparative case series, the highest score was 10 of 16, with a median (range) score of 7.5 (4 to 10), while the two comparative studies scored 22 of 24 and 19 of 24, respectively.

RESULTS:
Studies varied widely in terms of patient-reported outcome measures such as the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS), with inconsistent reporting across studies regarding whether or how much patients improved; there was variation in some effect sizes with regard to improvement seeming close to or below the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Although no perioperative complications were reported in any included studies, 34% (26 of 77, in seven studies that reported on this endpoint) of patients who underwent a revision procedure. One study found a negative association between lesion size and AOFAS and VAS score. No other studies reported on factors associated with patient-reported outcome scores, and most studies were far too small to explore relationships of this sort.

CONCLUSION:
We found that arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for secondary osteochondral lesions of the talus yielded inconsistent and often small improvements in patient-reported outcomes, with approximately one in three patients undergoing a revision procedure. Reported outcomes likely represent a best-case scenario, inflated by low-level study designs and major sources of bias that are known to make treatment effects seem larger than they are. Therefore, the use of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation in such patients cannot be recommended, unless we are able to refine selection criteria to effectively identify patients who show a substantial clinical benefit.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does the critical shoulder angle decrease after acromioplasty? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common shoulder injuries in the older population. This study aimed to determine whether acromioplasty reliably decreases the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and describe any associated complications.

METHODS:
A systematic literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library Database. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts using prespecified criteria. Studies where the acromioplasty was performed as a surgical procedure were included. Patient characteristics and degree of CSA reduction were collected from each individual study. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4.1 software. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.

RESULTS:
A total of 9 studies involving 1236 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The age of patients ranged from 23 to 82Â years. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 30Â months. Of the 9 studies, 8 (88.9%) were retrospective, 1 (11.1%) was prospective, 5 were comparative, and 4 were case series. The mean CSA was significantly reduced from 36.1Â°âÂ±â4.6Â° to 33.7Â°âÂ±â4.2 (pâ<â0.05). The meta-analysis showed an overall best estimate of the mean difference in pre- and postoperative CSA equal to 2.63Â° (95% confidence interval: 2.15, 3.11] (pâ<â0.00001).

CONCLUSIONS:
Acromioplasty can significantly reduce CSA, notably in cases of high preoperative CSA. In addition, the effect of lateral acromioplasty on the CSA was more significant compared to anterolateral acromioplasty. Acromioplasty was not associated with complications during the short-term follow-up.",Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common shoulder injuries in the older population.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,What is the impact of a fast-track pathway on length of stay for adult patients with a hip fracture? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
In orthopaedic surgery, hip fracture patients represent one of the largest cohorts. Hip fracture is a serious injury commonly occurring in frail and elderly patients. Fast-track admission pathways aim to streamline patients through accident and emergency departments, resulting in shorter wait times and less negative patient outcomes.

AIM:
To examine the impact of a fast-track pathway on length of stay for adults admitted to an acute hospital with a hip fracture.

METHODS:
CINAHL Plus with Full text (via EBSCO host), MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase database searches were carried out in January 2021, to find all relevant literature for this review, as well as through searching additional sources. Eligible studies were quantitative primary research, focusing on the use of fast-track admission pathway care versus usual care, for adults with a hip fracture. The assessment of study suitability, data extraction, and critical appraisal was carried out by two independent authors. A narrative analysis of the data was conducted, and data were meta-analysed using RevMan where possible. Quality appraisal of the included studies was undertaken using the EBL checklist.

RESULTS:
Seven studies reporting data on 5723 patients were included. Length of stay, time to surgery, and mortality did not differ significantly between the fast-track care, and usual care. One study reported on delirium and found statistically significantly fewer encounters of delirium in fast-track care versus usual care. Four of the seven studies satisfied rigorous quality appraisal (>â75%) using the EBL.

CONCLUSION:
The fast-track pathway avoided unnecessary delays in emergency departments due to faster X-rays, direct admission to orthopaedic wards, and reduced delirium rates. However, results were unable to show the impact of fast-track on length of stay, time to surgery, and mortality.","In orthopaedic surgery, hip fracture patients represent one of the largest cohorts.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,Does Biceps Tenotomy or Tenodesis Have Better Results After Surgery? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Although tenotomy and tenodesis are frequently used for long head of the biceps tendon lesions, controversies remain as to which technique is superior regarding pain, functionality, complications, and cosmetic appearance.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
(1) For long head of biceps tendon lesions, does tenotomy or tenodesis result in greater improvements in VAS score for pain? (2) Which approach has superior results when evaluating function outcome (Constant) scores? (3) Does tenotomy or tenodesis have fewer complications? (4) Does tenotomy or tenodesis result in better cosmesis (Popeye sign)?

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed in the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em CiÃªncias da SaÃºde (LILACS) using the keywords ""long head of the biceps tendon,"" ""biceps tenodesis,"" and ""tenotomy."" We completed the search in June 2020. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and quasirandomized controlled trials that investigated tenodesis and tenotomy with no language restriction and evaluation of adult patients who presented with a long head of the biceps tendon lesion, associated with other lesions or not, without previous shoulder surgeries and who had no response to nonoperative treatment. The initial search yielded 239 studies, 40 of which were duplicates. We assessed the titles and abstracts of 199 articles and excluded all studies that were not randomized controlled trials (literature reviews) or that compared different techniques. We assessed the full text of 14 articles and excluded the ones that were protocols and cohort studies. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. We included eight studies in this systematic review and meta-analysis, with a total of 615 participants, 306 of whom were treated with tenotomy and 309 with tenodesis. The median duration of follow-up was 2 years. Overall, the included studies had a low risk of bias. The complications evaluated were adhesive capsulitis, biceps brachii tear, cramps, and a subsequent second surgical procedure. We used a random model in this meta-analysis so that we could generalize the results beyond the included studies. In this study, we only reported differences between the groups if they were both statistically valid and larger than the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).

RESULTS:
Comparing tenotomy and tenodesis, we observed no difference between the groups regarding pain in the long term (mean difference 0.25 [95% confidence interval -0.29 to 0.80]; p = 0.36). There was no difference in Constant score in the long-term (mean difference -1.45 [95% CI -2.96 to 0.06]; p = 0.06). There were no differences when evaluating for major complications (odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI 0.29 to 6.56]; p = 0.70). There were not enough papers evaluating adhesive capsulitis, cramping, and risk of revision surgery. Popeye sign was more frequent in the tenotomy group than in the tenodesis group (OR 4.70 [95% CI 2.71 to 8.17]; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:
This systematic review demonstrated that tenotomy and tenodesis offer satisfactory treatment for long head of the biceps tendon lesions. In terms of pain improvement and Constant score, there was no difference between the techniques, but patients undergoing tenotomy have worse cosmetic results. Therefore, surgeons should choose the technique based on their skills and the patient's expectations of surgery, such as cosmesis and time to recovery. More studies are needed to evaluate complications such as adhesive capsulitis and cramping, as well as to compare duration of surgery and recovery time for each technique.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,What Is the Relative Effectiveness of the Various Surgical Treatment Options for Distal Radius Fractures? A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

METHODS:
Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years (56 to 63) and was similar across all treatment groups except for dynamic external fixation (44 years) and fragment-specific plating (47 years). Distribution of intraarticular and extraarticular fractures was approximately equal among the treatment groups other than that for intramedullary fixation (73% extraarticular), fragment-specific plating (66% intraarticular) [13, 70], and dorsal plating (100% intraarticular). Outcomes were the DASH score at 1 year, total complications, and reoperation. The minimum clinically important different (MCID) for the DASH score was set at 10 points. The analysis was performed using Bayesian methodology with random-effects models. Rank orders were generated using surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Evidence quality was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most studies had a low risk of bias due to randomization and low rates of incomplete follow-up, unclear risk of bias due to selective reporting, and high risk of bias due to lack of patient and assessor blinding. Studies assessing bridging external fixation and/or nonoperative treatment arms had a higher overall risk of bias while studies with volar plating and/or percutaneous pinning treatment arms had a lower risk of bias.

RESULTS:
Across all patients, there were no clinically important differences in terms of the DASH score at 1 year; although differences were found, all were less than the MCID of 10 points. Volar plating was ranked the highest for DASH score at 1 year (mean difference -7.34 [95% credible interval -11 to -3.7) while intramedullary fixation, with low-quality evidence, also showed improvement in DASH score (mean difference -7.75 [95% CI -14.6 to -0.56]). The subgroup analysis revealed that only locked volar plating was favored over nonoperative treatment for patients older than 60 years of age (mean difference -6.4 [95% CI -11 to -2.1]) and for those with intraarticular fractures (mean difference -8.4 [95% CI -15 to -2.0]). However, its clinical importance was uncertain as the MCID was not met. Among all patients, intramedullary fixation (odds ratio 0.09 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.84]) and locked volar plating (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.39]) were associated with a lower complication risk compared with nonoperative treatment. For intraarticular fractures, volar plating was the only treatment associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.021 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.50]). For extraarticular fractures, only nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.011 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.65]), although the quality of evidence was low. Among all patients, the risk of complications requiring operation was lower with intramedullary fixation (OR 0.06 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.85) than with nonoperative treatment, but no treatment was favored over nonoperative treatment when analyzed by subgroups.

CONCLUSION:
We found no clinically important differences favoring any surgical treatment option with respect to 1-year functional outcome. However, relative to the other options, volar plating was associated with a lower complication risk, particularly in patients with intraarticular fractures, while nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower complication risk in patients with extraarticular fractures. For patients older than 60 years of age, nonoperative treatment may still be the preferred option because there is no reliable evidence showing a consistent decrease in complications or complications requiring operation among the other treatment options. Particularly in this age group, the decision to expose patients to even a single surgery should be made with caution.

Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years (56 to 63) and was similar across all treatment groups except for dynamic external fixation (44 years) and fragment-specific plating (47 years). Distribution of intraarticular and extraarticular fractures was approximately equal among the treatment groups other than that for intramedullary fixation (73% extraarticular), fragment-specific plating (66% intraarticular) [13, 70], and dorsal plating (100% intraarticular). Outcomes were the DASH score at 1 year, total complications, and reoperation. The minimum clinically important different (MCID) for the DASH score was set at 10 points. The analysis was performed using Bayesian methodology with random-effects models. Rank orders were generated using surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Evidence quality was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most studies had a low risk of bias due to randomization and low rates of incomplete follow-up, unclear risk of bias due to selective reporting, and high risk of bias due to lack of patient and assessor blinding. Studies assessing bridging external fixation and/or nonoperative treatment arms had a higher overall risk of bias while studies with volar plating and/or percutaneous pinning treatment arms had a lower risk of bias.","Across all patients, there were no clinically important differences in terms of the DASH score at 1 year; although differences were found, all were less than the MCID of 10 points. Volar plating was ranked the highest for DASH score at 1 year (mean difference -7.34 [95% credible interval -11 to -3.7) while intramedullary fixation, with low-quality evidence, also showed improvement in DASH score (mean difference -7.75 [95% CI -14.6 to -0.56]). The subgroup analysis revealed that only locked volar plating was favored over nonoperative treatment for patients older than 60 years of age (mean difference -6.4 [95% CI -11 to -2.1]) and for those with intraarticular fractures (mean difference -8.4 [95% CI -15 to -2.0]). However, its clinical importance was uncertain as the MCID was not met. Among all patients, intramedullary fixation (odds ratio 0.09 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.84]) and locked volar plating (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.39]) were associated with a lower complication risk compared with nonoperative treatment. For intraarticular fractures, volar plating was the only treatment associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.021 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.50]). For extraarticular fractures, only nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.011 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.65]), although the quality of evidence was low. Among all patients, the risk of complications requiring operation was lower with intramedullary fixation (OR 0.06 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.85) than with nonoperative treatment, but no treatment was favored over nonoperative treatment when analyzed by subgroups.","We found no clinically important differences favoring any surgical treatment option with respect to 1-year functional outcome. However, relative to the other options, volar plating was associated with a lower complication risk, particularly in patients with intraarticular fractures, while nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower complication risk in patients with extraarticular fractures. For patients older than 60 years of age, nonoperative treatment may still be the preferred option because there is no reliable evidence showing a consistent decrease in complications or complications requiring operation among the other treatment options. Particularly in this age group, the decision to expose patients to even a single surgery should be made with caution.",33165042,"['2281760', '19857180', '26229804', '28459418', '28459418', '22159849', '16819684', '31404224', '15911669', '24350132', '25491556', '20587064', '27026969', '27026969', '21659011', '25869062', '25981715', '25981715', '25096595', '22178307', '20213715', '21527140', '27795951', '18757963', '20686059', '23298757', '23298757', '25869061', '18450631', '25918348', '24175606', '30532300', '23677960', '29228851', '28040073', '24268189', '23420065', '26157739', '22051229', '16039370', '26686771', '10418864', '21185693', '15465230', '15465230', '22008217', '22008217', '22008217', '21667729', '2179492', '20660231', '2915010', '8773720', '26030634', '26030634', '22340861', '18977831', '18489499', '21704995', '24088965', '11327415', '10191737', '16061315', '25157038', '12954249', '15469032', '19234890', '22144746', '22144746', '28089163', '21895505', '7615598', '20190108', '25255722', '9246988', '24881899', '18706124', '27264899', '20237186', '20237186', '30950723', '20691441', '9699834', '8636175', '23674332', '20338565', '19622551', '15116824', '31045666', '26709818', '25050752', '29064312', '22331277', '25840480', '25840480', '7706344', '25252733', '25252733', '22755281', '9181506', '25446409', '19651939', '22281114', '23442339', '31404192', '31169572', '22150146', '22150146', '22150146', '30669897', '8056795', '23481405', '32301767', '9783616', '15590845', '22422832', '26773962', '25765534', '31232797', '27042540', '28144268', '30497657', '23523527', '23523527', '22108259', '19571078', '23569022', '12672842', '12183797', '26062085', '21281262', '23890493', '19620184', '23594247', '28057101', '30354018', '29031702', '24910215', '28389838', '26169601']",[],What Is the Relative Effectiveness of the Various Surgical Treatment Options for Distal Radius Fractures?,8/5/2021,What Is the Relative Effectiveness of the Various Surgical Treatment Options for Distal Radius Fractures?,"Across all patients, there were no clinically important differences in terms of the DASH score at 1 year; although differences were found, all were less than the MCID of 10 points.

emergency medicine,adult trauma,"Is the Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) Associated with Risk of Time-Loss Injury in Professional Team Sports? A Systematic Review of Methodology, Variables and Injury Risk in Practical Situations.","BACKGROUND:
The acute: chronic workload ratio (ACWR) is an index of the acute workload relative to the cumulative chronic workloads. The monitoring of physical workloads using the ACWR has emerged and been hypothesized as a useful tool for coaches and athletes to optimize performance while aiming to reduce the risk of potentially preventable load-driven injuries.

OBJECTIVES:
Our goal was to describe characteristics of the ACWR and investigate the association of the ACWR with the risk of time-loss injuries in adult elite team sport athletes.

DATA SOURCES:
PubMed, EMBASE and grey literature databases; inception to May 2019.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
Longitudinal studies that assess the relationship of the ACWR and time-loss injury risk in adult professional or elite team sports.

METHODS:
We summarized the population characteristics, workload metrics and ACWR calculation methods. For each workload metric, we plotted the risk estimates for the ACWR in isolation, or when combined with chronic workloads. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black scale.

RESULTS:
Twenty studies comprising 2375 injuries from 1234 athletes (all males and mean age of 24Â years) from different sports were included. Internal (65%) and external loads (70%) were collected in more than half of the studies and the session-rating of perceived exertion and total distance were the most commonly collected metrics. The ACWR was commonly calculated using the coupled method (95%), 1:4 weekly blocks (95%) and subsequent week injury lag (80%). There were 14 different binning methods with almost none of the studies using the same binning categories.

CONCLUSION:
The majority of studies suggest that athletes are at greater risk of sustaining a time-loss injury when the ACWR is higher relative to a lower or moderate ACWR. The heterogenous methodological approaches not only reflect the wide range of sports studied and the differing demands of these activities, but also limit the strength of recommendations.

emergency medicine,emergency medical services,Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
This systematic review was conducted to evaluate any interventions to prevent incident delirium, or shorten the duration of prevalent delirium, in older adults presenting to the emergency department (ED).

METHODS:
Health sciences librarian designed electronic searches were conducted from database inception through September 2021. Two authors reviewed studies, and included studies that evaluated interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of delirium and excluded non-ED studies. The risk of bias (ROB) was evaluated by the Cochrane ROB tool or the Newcastle-Ottawa (NOS) scale. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate a pooled effect of multifactorial programs on delirium prevention.

RESULTS:
Our search strategy yielded 11,900 studies of which 10 met study inclusion criteria. Two RCTs evaluated pharmacologic interventions for delirium prevention; three non-RCTs employed a multi-factorial delirium prevention program; three non-RCTs evaluated regional anesthesia for hip fractures; and one study evaluated the use of Foley catheter, medication exposure, and risk of delirium. Only four studies demonstrated a significant impact on delirium incidence or duration of delirium-one RCT of melatonin reduced the incidence of delirium (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.62), one non-RCT study on a multi-factorial program decreased inpatient delirium prevalence (41% to 19%) and the other reduced incident delirium (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61). One case-control study on the use of ED Foley catheters in the ED increased the duration of delirium (proportional OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 7.4). A pooled odds ratio for three multifactorial programs on delirium prevention was 0.46 (95% CI 0.31-0.68, I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 0).

CONCLUSION:
Few interventions initiated in the ED were found to consistently reduce the incidence or duration of delirium. Delirium prevention and treatment trials in the ED are still rare and should be prioritized for future research.","This systematic review was conducted to evaluate any interventions to prevent incident delirium, or shorten the duration of prevalent delirium, in older adults presenting to the emergency department (ED).","Health sciences librarian designed electronic searches were conducted from database inception through September 2021.

emergency medicine,emergency medical services,Antimicrobial stewardship programs in emergency departments: how do we measure antimicrobial use? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE:
The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) has become a usual practice in hospital settings. However, the method for monitoring antimicrobial use in accident and emergency departments (ED) is not yet adequately defined. Thus, the objective of this review is to describe antimicrobial use indicators used by ASPs implemented in ED.

METHODS:
A systematic review was performed based on studies found in the following academic research databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus (Period: January 2000 to December 2019). Controlled clinical trials, before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies assessing the impact of ASPs on antimicrobial use in ED were included; studies published in languages other than English or Spanish were excluded from this review.

RESULTS:
Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. In total, 15 (62.5%) studies described the ASP team members who collaborated with the ED staff. Most (21; 80.8%) studies used the percentage of patients with an antibiotic prescription as an indicator. Four (15.4%) studies included defined daily dose data. The antibiotic treatment duration was reported in four (15.4%) studies. Only two studies assessed the impact of the ASP using microbiological indicators, both of which used the incidence of infection with Clostridioides difficile as the indicator.

CONCLUSIONS:
The reports of experiences in implementing ASPs in ED show heterogeneous antimicrobial use indicators, which makes it difficult to compare results. Therefore, antimicrobial use indicators for ASPs must be standardised between hospital units.","The implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) has become a usual practice in hospital settings.

emergency medicine,emergency medical services,Does Deprescribing Improve Quality of Life? A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Deprescribing has been shown to reduce potentially inappropriate or unnecessary medications; however, whether these benefits translate into improved quality of life (QOL) is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to isolate the impact of deprescribing on patient or designated representative reported QOL; satisfaction with care (SWC) and emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were also investigated to further explore this question.

METHODS:
This systematic review searched the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from database inception until November 2017. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized prospective studies of older adults (>â65Â years or older) and older persons with life-limiting conditions were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the search results and performed risk of bias assessments. Data on QOL, SWC, and ED visits and hospitalizations were extracted from all identified studies. Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using measures recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.

RESULTS:
Screening of 6543 eligible records identified 12 studies within 13 articles. In ten studies investigating the reduction of at least one medication deprescribed, compared with usual care, all but two found no difference in QOL. To date there has only been one study examining the impact of deprescribing on SWC, which was found to be not statistically significant. Four studies exploring the impact of deprescribing on ED visits and hospitalizations also found no significant difference. However, many studies were found to have a higher performance, detection, or other bias. We found considerable heterogeneity in patient populations, targeted medications for deprescribing, and QOL measurements used in these studies.

CONCLUSION:
Based on a limited number of studies with varying methodological rigor, deprescribing may not significantly improve QOL or SWC; however, it may not contribute to additional ED visits and hospitalizations.

emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Does type of funding affect reporting in network meta-analysis? A scoping review of network meta-analyses.,"BACKGROUND:
Evidence has shown that private industry-sponsored randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses are more likely to report intervention-favourable results compared with other sources of funding. However, this has not been assessed in network meta-analyses (NMAs).

OBJECTIVES:
To (a) explore the recommendation rate of industry-sponsored NMAs on their company's intervention, and (b) assess reporting in NMAs of pharmacologic interventions according to their funding type.

METHODS:
Design: Scoping review of published NMAs with RCTs.

INFORMATION SOURCES:
We used a pre-existing NMA database including 1,144 articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, published between January 2013 and July 2018.

STUDY SELECTION:
NMAs with transparent funding information and comparing pharmacologic interventions with/without placebo.

SYNTHESIS:
We captured whether NMAs recommended their own or another company's intervention, classified NMAs according to their primary outcome findings (i.e., statistical significance and direction of effect), and according to the overall reported conclusion. We assessed reporting using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension to NMA (PRISMA-NMA) 32-item checklist. We matched and compared industry with non-industry NMAs having the same research question, disease, primary outcome, and pharmacologic intervention against placebo/control.

RESULTS:
We retrieved 658 NMAs, which reported a median of 23 items in the PRISMA-NMA checklist (interquartile range [IQR]: 21-26). NMAs were categorized as 314 publicly-sponsored (PRISMA-NMA median 24.5, IQR 22-27), 208 non-sponsored (PRISMA-NMA median 23, IQR 20-25), and 136 industry/mixed-sponsored NMAs (PRISMA-NMA median 21, IQR 19-24). Most industry-sponsored NMAs recommended their own manufactured drug (92%), suggested a statistically significant positive treatment-effect for their drug (82%), and reported an overall positive conclusion (92%). Our matched NMAs (25 industry vs 25 non-industry) indicated that industry-sponsored NMAs had favourable conclusions more often (100% vs 80%) and were associated with larger (but not statistically significantly different) efficacy effect sizes (in 61% of NMAs) compared with non-industry-sponsored NMAs.

CONCLUSIONS:
Differences in completeness of reporting and author characteristics were apparent among NMAs with different types of funding. Publicly-sponsored NMAs had the best reporting and published their findings in higher impact-factor journals. Knowledge users should be mindful of this potential funding bias in NMAs.","To (a) explore the recommendation rate of industry-sponsored NMAs on their company's intervention, and (b) assess reporting in NMAs of pharmacologic interventions according to their funding type.",Design: Scoping review of published NMAs with RCTs.,"We retrieved 658 NMAs, which reported a median of 23 items in the PRISMA-NMA checklist (interquartile range [IQR]: 21-26).

emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Can statistical adjustment guided by causal inference improve the accuracy of effect estimation? A simulation and empirical research based on meta-analyses of case-control studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Statistical adjustment is often considered to control confounding bias in observational studies, especially case-control studies. However, different adjustment strategies may affect the estimation of odds ratios (ORs), and in turn affect the results of their pooled analyses. Our study is aimed to investigate how to deal with the statistical adjustment in case-control studies to improve the validity of meta-analyses.

METHODS:
Three types of adjustment strategies were evaluated including insufficient adjustment (not all preset confounders were adjusted), full adjustment (all confounders were adjusted under the guidance of causal inference), and improper adjustment (covariates other than confounders were adjusted). We carried out a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments based on predesigned scenarios, and assessed the accuracy of effect estimations from meta-analyses of case-control studies by combining ORs calculated according to different adjustment strategies. Then we used the data from an empirical review to illustrate the replicability of the simulation results.

RESULTS:
For all scenarios with different strength of causal relations, combining ORs that were comprehensively adjusted for confounders would get the most precise effect estimation. By contrast, combining ORs that were not sufficiently adjusted for confounders or improperly adjusted for mediators or colliders would easily introduce bias in causal interpretation, especially when the true effect of exposure on outcome was weak or none. The findings of the simulation experiments were further verified by the empirical research.

CONCLUSIONS:
Statistical adjustment guided by causal inference are recommended for effect estimation. Therefore, when conducting meta-analyses of case-control studies, the causal relationship formulated by exposure, outcome, and covariates should be firstly understood through a directed acyclic graph, and then reasonable original ORs could be extracted and combined by suitable methods.","Statistical adjustment is often considered to control confounding bias in observational studies, especially case-control studies.

emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Paediatric flexible flat foot: how are we measuring it and are we getting it right? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Flexible flat foot is a normal observation in typically developing children, however, some children with flat feet present with pain and impaired lower limb function. The challenge for health professionals is to identify when foot posture is outside of expected findings and may warrant intervention. Diagnoses of flexible flat foot is often based on radiographic or clinical measures, yet the validity and reliability of these measures for a paediatric population is not clearly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate how paediatric foot posture is defined and measured within the literature, and if the psychometric properties of these measures support any given diagnoses.

METHODS:
Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED, SportDiscus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were systematically searched in January 2017 for empirical studies where participants had diagnosed flexible flat foot and were aged 18Â years or younger. Outcomes of interest were the foot posture measures and definitions used. Further articles were sought where cited in relation to the psychometric properties of the measures used.

RESULTS:
Of the 1101 unique records identified by the searches, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 20Â foot posture measures and 40 definitions of paediatric flexible flat foot. A further 18 citations were sought in relation to the psychometric properties of these measures. Three measures were deemed valid and reliable, the FPI-6â>â+â6 for children aged three to 15Â years, a Staheli arch index of >â1.07 for children aged three to six andââ¥â1.28 for children six to nine, and a Chippaux-Smirak index of >â62.7% in three to seven year olds, >â59% in six to nine year olds andââ¥â40% for children aged nine to 16Â years. No further measures were found to be valid for the paediatric population.

CONCLUSION:
No universally accepted criteria for diagnosing paediatric flat foot was found within existing literature, and psychometric data for foot posture measures and definitions used was limited. The outcomes of this review indicate that the FPI - 6, Staheli arch index or Chippaux-Smirak index should be the preferred method of paediatric foot posture measurement in future research.","Flexible flat foot is a normal observation in typically developing children, however, some children with flat feet present with pain and impaired lower limb function.

emergency medicine,pediatric procedures,Can statistic adjustment of OR minimize the potential confounding bias for meta-analysis of case-control study? A secondary data analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Different confounder adjustment strategies were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) in case-control study, i.e. how many confounders original studies adjusted and what the variables are. This secondary data analysis is aimed to detect whether there are potential biases caused by difference of confounding factor adjustment strategies in case-control study, and whether such bias would impact the summary effect size of meta-analysis.

METHODS:
We included all meta-analyses that focused on the association between breast cancer and passive smoking among non-smoking women, as well as each original case-control studies included in these meta-analyses. The relative deviations (RDs) of each original study were calculated to detect how magnitude the adjustment would impact the estimation of ORs, compared with crude ORs. At the same time, a scatter diagram was sketched to describe the distribution of adjusted ORs with different number of adjusted confounders.

RESULTS:
Substantial inconsistency existed in meta-analysis of case-control studies, which would influence the precision of the summary effect size. First, mixed unadjusted and adjusted ORs were used to combine individual OR in majority of meta-analysis. Second, original studies with different adjustment strategies of confounders were combined, i.e. the number of adjusted confounders and different factors being adjusted in each original study. Third, adjustment did not make the effect size of original studies trend to constringency, which suggested that model fitting might have failed to correct the systematic error caused by confounding.

CONCLUSIONS:
The heterogeneity of confounder adjustment strategies in case-control studies may lead to further bias for summary effect size in meta-analyses, especially for weak or medium associations so that the direction of causal inference would be even reversed. Therefore, further methodological researches are needed, referring to the assessment of confounder adjustment strategies, as well as how to take this kind of bias into consideration when drawing conclusion based on summary estimation of meta-analyses.","Different confounder adjustment strategies were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) in case-control study, i.e. how many confounders original studies adjusted and what the variables are. This secondary data analysis is aimed to detect whether there are potential biases caused by difference of confounding factor adjustment strategies in case-control study, and whether such bias would impact the summary effect size of meta-analysis.","We included all meta-analyses that focused on the association between breast cancer and passive smoking among non-smoking women, as well as each original case-control studies included in these meta-analyses. The relative deviations (RDs) of each original study were calculated to detect how magnitude the adjustment would impact the estimation of ORs, compared with crude ORs. At the same time, a scatter diagram was sketched to describe the distribution of adjusted ORs with different number of adjusted confounders.","Substantial inconsistency existed in meta-analysis of case-control studies, which would influence the precision of the summary effect size. First, mixed unadjusted and adjusted ORs were used to combine individual OR in majority of meta-analysis. Second, original studies with different adjustment strategies of confounders were combined, i.e. the number of adjusted confounders and different factors being adjusted in each original study. Third, adjustment did not make the effect size of original studies trend to constringency, which suggested that model fitting might have failed to correct the systematic error caused by confounding.","The heterogeneity of confounder adjustment strategies in case-control studies may lead to further bias for summary effect size in meta-analyses, especially for weak or medium associations so that the direction of causal inference would be even reversed.

emergency medicine,pediatric trauma,Are hypothalamic- pituitary (HP) axis deficiencies after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of relevance for adult cancer patients? - a systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Cranial radiotherapy (cRT) can induce hormonal deficiencies as a consequence of significant doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis. In contrast to profound endocrinological follow-up data from survivors of childhood cancer treated with cRT, little knowledge exists for adult cancer patients.

METHODS:
A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database and the Cochrane library offering the basis for our debate of the relevance of HP axis impairment after cRT in adult cancer patients. Against the background of potential relevance for patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), a particular focus was set on the temporal onset of hypopituitarism and the radiation dose to the HP axis.

RESULTS:
Twenty-eight original papers with a total of 1728 patients met the inclusion criteria. Radiation doses to the HP area ranged from 4 to 97 Gray (Gy). Hypopituitarism incidences ranged from 20 to 93% for adult patients with nasopharyngeal cancer or non-pituitary brain tumors. No study focused particularly on hypopituitarism after WBRT. The onset of hypopituitarism occurred as early as within the first year following cRT (range: 3âmonths to 25.6âyears). However, since most studies started follow-up evaluation only several years after cRT, early onset of hypopituitarism might have gone unnoticed.

CONCLUSION:
Hypopituitarism occurs frequently after cRT in adult cancer patients. Despite the general conception that it develops only after several years, onset of endocrine sequelae can occur within the first year after cRT without a clear threshold. This finding is worth debating particularly in respect of treatment options for patients with brain metastases and favorable survival prognoses.","Cranial radiotherapy (cRT) can induce hormonal deficiencies as a consequence of significant doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis.

emergency medicine,pediatric trauma,Is percutaneous pinning needed for the treatment of displaced distal radius metaphyseal fractures in children?: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Distal radius metaphyseal (DRM) fractures are very frequent childhood fractures. Whether additional percutaneous pinning improves the outcome remains controversial. In this review, we tried to systematically evaluate the effect of percutaneous pinning on re-displacement, secondary reduction, radiographs, function, and complications in children with displaced DRM fractures.

METHODS:
PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were explored systematically to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) comparing cast immobilization alone or following reduction to additional percutaneous pinning in the treatment of pediatric displaced DRM fractures. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles and extracted relevant information from each article. The methodological quality of eligible articles was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk assessment tool (RCTs) and modified Jadad scale (CCTs).

RESULTS:
A total of 4 RCTs and 3 CCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total patient count of 1144 children. The results showed that additional percutaneous pinning significantly reduced the rate of re-placement (Chi-square tests, Pâ<â.001) and complications (Chi-square tests, Pâ=â.030). The superior results, both radiographically and functionally seemed to be temporary. No difference was found between the 2 groups after longer-term follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review suggested that compared with casting following reduction, percutaneous pinning had a positive effect on maintaining the initial reduction and reducing fracture complication rate of displaced DRM fractures in children, but with no significant improvement in function and radiographic outcome at the long-term follow-up. We suggest clinicians think twice before percutaneous pinning of displaced pediatric DRM fractures.","Distal radius metaphyseal (DRM) fractures are very frequent childhood fractures.

endocrinology,adrenal disease,Are Corticosteroid Injections Associated With Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency in Adults With Musculoskeletal Pain? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prospective Studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Corticosteroid injection is a common treatment for individuals experiencing musculoskeletal pain, and it is part of the management of numerous orthopaedic conditions. However, there is concern about offering corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal pain because of the possibility of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies, we asked: (1) Are corticosteroid injections associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency as measured by 7-day morning serum cortisol? (2) Does this association differ depending on whether the shot was administered in the spine or the appendicular skeleton?

METHODS:
We searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Embase, EmCare, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to January 22, 2021. We retrieved 4303 unique records, of which 17 were eventually included. Study appraisal was via the Downs and Black tool, with an average quality rating of fair. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment was conducted with the overall certainty of evidence being low to moderate. Reflecting heterogeneity in the study estimates, a pooled random-effects estimate of cortisol levels 7 days after corticosteroid injection was calculated. Fifteen studies or subgroups (254 participants) provided appropriate estimates for statistical pooling. A total of 106 participants received a spine injection, and 148 participants received an appendicular skeleton injection, including the glenohumeral joint, subacromial bursa, trochanteric bursa, and knee.

RESULTS:
Seven days after corticosteroid injection, the mean morning serum cortisol was 212 nmol/L (95% confidence interval 133 to 290), suggesting that secondary adrenal insufficiency was a possible outcome. There is a difference in the secondary adrenal insufficiency risk depending on whether the injection was in the spine or the appendicular skeleton. For spinal injection, the mean cortisol was 98 nmol/L (95% CI 48 to 149), suggesting secondary adrenal insufficiency was likely. For appendicular skeleton injection the mean cortisol was 311 nmol/L (95% CI 213 to 409) suggesting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity was likely.

CONCLUSION:
Clinicians offering spinal injections should discuss the possibility of short-term secondary adrenal insufficiency with patients, and together, they can decide whether the treatment remains appropriate and whether mitigation strategies are needed. Clinicians offering appendicular skeleton injections should not limit care because of concerns about secondary adrenal insufficiency based on the best available evidence, and clinical guidelines could be reviewed accordingly. Further research is needed to understand whether age and/or sex determine risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency and what clinical impact secondary adrenal insufficiency has on patients undergoing spinal injection.

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Is metformin use associated with low mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19? a multivariable and propensity score-adjusted meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic that the entire world is facing since December of 2019. Increasing evidence has shown that metformin is linked to favorable outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to address whether outpatient or inpatient metformin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with low in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

METHODS:
We searched studies published in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library up to November 1, 2022. Raw event data extracted from individual study were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel approach. Odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for covariates that potentially confound the association using multivariable regression or propensity score matching was pooled by the inverse-variance method. Random effect models were applied for meta-analysis due to variance among studies.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two retrospective observational studies were selected. The pooled unadjusted OR for outpatient metformin therapy and in-hospital mortality was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.37-0.62) and the pooled OR adjusted with multivariable regression or propensity score matching was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.50-0.99). The pooled unadjusted OR for inpatient metformin therapy and in-hospital mortality was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.10-0.31), whereas the pooled adjusted HR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.38-3.15).

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,"After Dinner Rest a While, After Supper Walk a Mile? A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis on the Acute Postprandial Glycemic Response to Exercise Before and After Meal Ingestion in Healthy Subjects and Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance.","BACKGROUND:
The most effective way to cope with high blood sugar spikes is to engage in physical activity in temporal proximity to food intake. However, so far, it is unclear as to whether there is an optimal time for physical activity around food intake.

OBJECTIVES:
We aimed to identify the impact of pre- and post-meal exercise on postprandial glucose excursions in humans with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022324070. We screened MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane/CINAHL/EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge until 1 May, 2022. We used the risk of bias rating with the crossover extension of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool II. Standardized mean differences (SMDs, Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as pooled effect estimates of a random-effects meta-analysis. Eligibility criteria included three-armed randomized controlled trials comparing the acute effects of pre- and post-meal exercise to a no-exercise control in humans.

RESULTS:
Eight randomized controlled trials (crossover trials, high risk of bias) with 30 interventions in 116 participants (47 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 69 without type 2 diabetes) were eligible. Exercise after meal ingestion (real food or meal replacement drinks) led to a reduction in postprandial glucose excursions compared with exercise before eating (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=â0.47 [95% CI 0.23, 0.70]) and an inactive control condition (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=â0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.75]. Pre-meal exercise did not lead to significantly lower postprandial glucose compared to an inactive control (15 effect sizes; SMDâ=ââ-â0.13 [95% CIâ-â0.42, 0.17]). The time between meal and exercise (estimateâ=ââ-â0.0151; standard errorâ=â0.00473; Zâ=ââ-â3.19; pâ=â0.001; 95% CIâ-â0.024,â-â0.006) had a moderating influence on postprandial glucose excursions.

CONCLUSIONS:
Exercise, i.e., walking, has a greater acute beneficial impact on postprandial hyperglycemia when undertaken as soon as possible after a meal rather than after a longer interval or before eating.

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Is non-high-density lipoprotein associated with metabolic syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) which is calculated by subtracting the HDL-C value from the total cholesterol level, atherogenic index (ratio between triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C concentrations (TG/HDL-C)), and Diff-C (calculated by subtracting low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) from non-HDL-C), have been known as valuable predictors of dyslipidemia and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have reported the potential association of novel atherogenic lipid indices with metabolic syndrome (MetS). This meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled association of novel atherogenic lipid indices with MetS or its components.

METHODS:
A systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) databases from January 2000 until March 2021 to evaluate the association of novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-HDL-C, atherogenic index, and the difference between non-HDL-C and LDL-C (Diff-C) with MetS. Observational studies were included without any language restriction. As exclusive studies evaluating the association of non-HDL-C with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were eligible to be included in quantitative analyses, a random-effect meta-analysis was performed to pool the odds ratios (ORs). A stratified meta-analysis was performed based on the definition of MetS [Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF)] and the studied population.

RESULTS:
Overall, 318 studies were retrieved from an initial systematic search. After screening, 18 and five studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses, respectively. Qualitative synthesis revealed an association between non-HDL-C, Diff-C, and atherogenic index with MetS and its components. Stratified meta-analysis showed that an increased non-HDL-C level was associated with an increased odds of MetS based on ATP criteria (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 2.14-5.39) and IDF criteria (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.98-3.44) in adults (OR: 3.53, 95% CI: 2.29-4.78) and in children (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.65-2.90).

CONCLUSION:
Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including atherogenic index, Diff-c, and non-HDL-C, are strongly associated with increased odds of MetS and its components. The indices could be considered as potential predictors of MetS and its components in clinical practice.","Novel atherogenic lipid indices, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) which is calculated by subtracting the HDL-C value from the total cholesterol level, atherogenic index (ratio between triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C concentrations (TG/HDL-C)), and Diff-C (calculated by subtracting low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) from non-HDL-C), have been known as valuable predictors of dyslipidemia and subsequent cardiovascular diseases.

endocrinology,diabetes mellitus,Human amniotic membrane products for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. do they help? a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most serious diabetic complications. DFU is an open wound that usually occurs in the foot sole due to poor blood glucose control, peripheral neuropathy, and poor circulation. The human amniotic allograft membrane is a biological wound dressing derived from the amniotic membrane. It contains amino acids, nutrients, cytokines, and growth factors that make the growth process easier.

OBJECTIVE:
To compare dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (DHACA) plus the standard of wound care (SOC) with the SOC alone.

METHODS:
We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science till April 2021 using relevant keywords. All search results were screened for eligibility. We extracted the data from the included trials and pooled them as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager software (ver. 5.4).

RESULTS:
The pooled effect estimate from 11 RCTs showed that DHACA was superior to SOC regarding the complete wound healing in both 6th and 12th week (RRâ=â3.78; 95% CI: [2.51, 5.70]; Pâ<â0.00001) and (RRâ=â2.00; 95% CI: [1.67, 2.39], Pâ<â0.00001 respectively). Also, the analysis favored the DHACA regarding the mean time to heal in the 12th-week (MDâ=â-12.07, 95%CI: [-19.23, -4.91], Pâ=â0.001). The wound size reduction was better with DHACA (MDâ=â1.18, 95%CI: [-0,10, 2.26], Pâ=â0.03).

CONCLUSION:
Using DHACA with SOC is safer and more effective than using SOC alone for DFU patients.",To compare dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (DHACA) plus the standard of wound care (SOC) with the SOC alone.,"We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science till April 2021 using relevant keywords.

endocrinology,bone disorders,"Are the Pathologic Features of Enthesopathy, Tendinopathy, and Labral and Articular Disc Disease Related to Mucoid Degeneration? A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND:
Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, labral degeneration, and pathologic conditions of the articular disc (knee meniscus and ulnocarpal) are sometimes described in terms of inflammation or damage, while the histopathologic findings are often consistent with mucoid degeneration. A systematic review of the histopathology of these structures at diverse locations might reconceptualize these diseases as expected aspects of human aging. The potential benefits of this evolution might include healthier patient and clinician mindsets as well as a reduced likelihood of overdiagnosis and overtreatment resulting from greater awareness of base rates of pathology.

QUESTION/PURPOSE:
In this systematic review of studies of surgical specimens, we asked: Are there are any differences in the histopathologic findings of structural soft tissue conditions (mucoid degeneration, inflammation, and vascularity) by anatomic site (foot, elbow, or knee) or structure (tendon body, muscle or tendon origin or insertion [enthesis], labrum, or articular disc)?

METHODS:
Studies between 1980 and 2021 investigating the histopathologic findings of specimens from surgery for trigger digit, de Quervain tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, lateral and medial elbow enthesopathy, rotator cuff tendinopathy, posterior tibial tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles tendinopathy, or disease of the hip labrum, ulnocarpal articular disc, or knee meniscus were searched for in the PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Inclusion criteria were the prespecified anatomic location or structure being analyzed histologically and any findings described with respect to inflammation, vascularity, or mucoid degeneration. Studies were excluded if they were nonhuman studies or review articles. Search terms included ""anatomy,"" ""pathology,"" and ""histopathology."" These terms were coupled with anatomic structures or disorders and included ""trigger finger,"" ""de Quervain,"" ""fasciitis, plantar,"" ""tennis elbow,"" ""rotator cuff tendinopathy,"" ""elbow tendinopathy,"" ""patellar tendonitis,"" ""posterior tibial tendon,"" and ""triangular fibrocartilage."" This resulted in 3196 studies. After applying the inclusion criteria, 559 articles were then assessed for eligibility according to our exclusion criteria, with 52 eventually included. We recorded whether the study identified the following histopathologic findings: inflammatory cells or molecular markers, greater than expected vascularity (categorized as quantitative count, with or without controls; molecular markers; or qualitative judgments), and features of mucoid degeneration (disorganized collagen, increased extracellular matrix, or chondroid metaplasia). In the absence of methods for systematically evaluating the pathophysiology of structural (collagenous) soft tissue structures and rating histopathologic study quality, all studies that interpreted histopathology results were included. The original authors' judgment regarding the presence or absence of inflammation, greater than expected vascularity, and elements of mucoid degeneration was recorded along with the type of data used to reach that conclusion.

RESULTS:
Regarding differences in the histopathology of surgical specimens of structural soft tissue conditions by anatomic site, there were no differences in inflammation or mucoid degeneration, and the knee meniscus was less often described as having greater than normal vascularity. There were no differences by anatomic structure. Overall, 20% (10 of 51) of the studies that investigated for inflammation reported it (nine inflammatory cells and one inflammatory marker). Eighty-three percent (43 of 52) interpreted increased vascularity: 40% (17 of 43) using quantitative methods (14 with controls and three without) and 60% (26 of 43) using imprecise criteria. Additionally, 100% (all 52 studies) identified at least one element of mucoid degeneration: 69% (36 of 52) reported an increased extracellular matrix, 71% (37 of 52) reported disorganized collagen, and 33% (17 of 52) reported chondroid metaplasia.

CONCLUSION:
Our systematic review of the histopathology of diseases of soft tissue structures (enthesopathy, tendinopathy, and labral and articular disc) identified consistent mucoid degeneration, minimal inflammation, and imprecise assessment of relative vascularity; these findings were consistent across anatomic sites and structures, supporting a reconceptualization of these diseases as related to aging (senescence or degeneration) rather than injury or activity.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
This reconceptualization supports accommodative mindsets known to be associated with greater comfort and capability. In addition, awareness of the notable base rates of structural soft tissue changes as people age might reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment of incidental, benign, or inconsequential signal changes and pathophysiology.","Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, labral degeneration, and pathologic conditions of the articular disc (knee meniscus and ulnocarpal) are sometimes described in terms of inflammation or damage, while the histopathologic findings are often consistent with mucoid degeneration.

endocrinology,bone disorders,Do disease status and race affect the efficacy of zoledronic acid in patients with prostate cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Zoledronic acid (ZA) does not improve the overall survival (OS) of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); however, little is known about the efficacy of ZA in to hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), and non- metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of ZA in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and different disease statuses.

METHODS:
Fifteen eligible randomized-control trials (RCTs) with ZA intervention, including 8280 participants with HSPC, mHSPC, nmCRPC, and mCRPC, were analyzed. The primary and secondary outcome were overall survival(OS), and skeletal-related events (SREs), and bone mineral density (BMD).

RESULTS:
The participants included 8280 men (7856 non-Asian and 424 Asian). Seven trials yielded a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95 (0.88, 1.03; P = 0.19) for OS. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant improvement in OS in the HSPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), M0 and M1(bone metastasis) groups, with pooled HR (95%CI) of 0.96 (0.88,1.05), 0.78 (0.46,1.33), 0.95 (0.81,1.13), 0.85 (0.69,1.04) respectively. The Asian group exhibited improved in OS with an HR of 0.67 (0.48, 0.95; P = 0.02), whereas the non-Asian group showed no improvement in OS with an HR of 0.97 (0.90, 1.06; P = 0.52). Five trials yielded pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 (0.45, 0.95; P = 0.02) for SREs. In the subgroup, SREs were significantly decreased in the M1 and Asian groups with ORs of 0.65 (0.45, 0.95; P = 0.02) and 0.42 (0.24, 0.71; P = 0.001), respectively. Six trials yielded a pooled mean difference (MD) of 8.08 (5.79, 10.37; P < 0.001) for BMD. In the HSPC we observed a stable improvement in increased BMD percentage with an MD (95%CI) of 6.65 (5.67, 7.62) (P = 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:
ZA intervention does not significantly improve OS in patients with prostate cancer (HSPC, CRPC, M0, M1) but probably improves OS in the Asian populations. M1 and Asian groups had exhibit a significant reduction in SREs regardless of the HSPC or CRPC status after ZA administration. Moreover, ZA treatment increases BMD percentage.","Zoledronic acid (ZA) does not improve the overall survival (OS) of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); however, little is known about the efficacy of ZA in to hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), and non- metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of ZA in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and different disease statuses.","Fifteen eligible randomized-control trials (RCTs) with ZA intervention, including 8280 participants with HSPC, mHSPC, nmCRPC, and mCRPC, were analyzed. The primary and secondary outcome were overall survival(OS), and skeletal-related events (SREs), and bone mineral density (BMD).","The participants included 8280 men (7856 non-Asian and 424 Asian). Seven trials yielded a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95 (0.88, 1.03; P = 0.19) for OS. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant improvement in OS in the HSPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), M0 and M1(bone metastasis) groups, with pooled HR (95%CI) of 0.96 (0.88,1.05), 0.78 (0.46,1.33), 0.95 (0.81,1.13), 0.85 (0.69,1.04) respectively. The Asian group exhibited improved in OS with an HR of 0.67 (0.48, 0.95; P = 0.02), whereas the non-Asian group showed no improvement in OS with an HR of 0.97 (0.90, 1.06; P = 0.52). Five trials yielded pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 (0.45, 0.95; P = 0.02) for SREs.

endocrinology,bone disorders,What is the Role of Scoliosis Surgery in Adolescents and Adults with Myelomeningocele? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Life expectancy of individuals with spina bifida has continued to improve over the past several decades. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of scoliosis in individuals with myelomeningocele (MMC), a spina bifida subtype, across their lifespan. Specifically, it is not known whether management during or after the transition years from adolescence to adulthood is associated with comorbidities in adulthood nor if these individuals benefit from scoliosis treatment later in life.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
In this systematic review, we asked: (1) Is the risk of secondary impairments (such as bladder or bowel incontinence, decreased ambulation, and skin pressure injuries) higher among adolescents and adults with MMC and scoliosis than among those with MMC without scoliosis? (2) Is there evidence that surgical management of scoliosis is associated with improved functional outcomes in adolescents and adults with MMC? (3) Is surgical management of scoliosis associated with improved quality of life in adolescents and adults with MMC?

METHODS:
We performed a systematic review of articles in Medline and Embase from 2000 until February 5, 2021. Search terms such as ""spinal dysraphism,"" ""spina bifida,"" ""meningomyelocele,"" and ""scoliosis"" were applied in diverse combinations. A total of 1429 publications were identified, and 13 were eligible for inclusion. We included original studies reporting on scoliosis among individuals older than 15 years with MMC. When available, we extracted the prevalence of MMC and scoliosis, studied population age, percentage of patients experiencing complications, functional outcomes, and overall physical function. We excluded non-English articles and those with fewer than 10 individuals with scoliosis and MMC. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, and registered the review before data collection (PROSPERO: CRD42021236357). We conducted a quality assessment using the Methodologic Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) tool. In 13 included studies, there were 556 individuals with MMC and scoliosis. Most were retrospective case series, although a minority were retrospective/comparative studies. The mean MINORS score was 12.3 Â± 1.65 (a MINORS score over 12 generally is considered good reporting quality, scores below 12 are considered at high risk of bias).

RESULTS:
In general, studies found that individuals with MMC and scoliosis were more likely to have secondary impairments such as bladder/bowel incontinence, decreased ambulation, and pressure injuries than were patients with MMC without scoliosis. These secondary impairments were associated with hydrocephalus and high-level MMC lesions. However, when one study evaluated mortality, the results showed that although most deceased individuals who had spina bifida had scoliosis, no association was found between the age of death and scoliosis. Among the studies evaluating functional outcomes, none supported strong functional improvement in individuals with MMC after surgery for scoliosis. No correlation between the Cobb angle and sitting balance was noted; however, the degree of pelvic obliquity and the level of motor dysfunction showed a strong correlation with scoliosis severity. There was no change in sitting pressure distributions after spinal surgery. The lesion level and scoliosis degree independently contributed to the degree of lung function impairment. Although studies reported success in correcting coronal deformity and stopping curve progression, they found no clear benefit of surgery on health-related quality of life and long-term outcomes. These studies demonstrated that the level of neurologic function, severity of hydrocephalus, and brainstem dysfunction are greater determinants of quality of life than spinal deformity.

CONCLUSION:
This systematic review found that adolescents and adults with MMC and scoliosis are more likely to have secondary impairments than their peers with MMC only. The best-available evidence does not support strong functional improvement or health-related quality of life enhancement after scoliosis surgery in adolescents and adults with MMC. The level of neurologic dysfunction, hydrocephalus, and brainstem dysfunction are greater determinants of quality of life. Future prospective studies should be designed to answer which individuals with MMC and scoliosis would benefit from spinal surgery. Our findings suggest that the very modest apparent benefits of surgery should cause surgeons to approach surgical recommendations in this patient population with great caution, and surgeons should counsel patients and their families that the risk of complications is high and the benefits may be small.

endocrinology,bone disorders,Is jaw fractal dimension a reliable biomarker for osteoporosis screening? A systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies.,"OBJECTIVES:
To summarize the evidence on the feasibility of maxillomandibular imaging exams-related fractal dimension (FD) in screening patients with osteoporosis.

METHODS:
This registered systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy statement. High sensitivity search strategies were developed for six primary databases and grey literature. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) items evaluated the risk of bias, and the GRADE approach assessed the evidence certainty.

RESULTS:
From 1034 records initially identified through database searching, four studies were included (total sample of 747 patients [osteoporosis, 136; control group, 611]). The meta-analysis showed that the overall sensitivity and specificity of the FD were 86.17 and 72.68%, respectively. In general, all studies showed low RoB and applicability concern. The certainty of the evidence was very low to moderate.

CONCLUSIONS:
This systematic review showed that the jaw-related FD presented sensitivity and specificity values higher than 70%, and its sensitivity in osteoporosis screening was a better parameter than specificity.",To summarize the evidence on the feasibility of maxillomandibular imaging exams-related fractal dimension (FD) in screening patients with osteoporosis.,"This registered systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy statement.

endocrinology,endocrine tumors,Laparoscopic vs. open mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: Are these approaches still comparable? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
To analyze pathologic and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic vs. open resections for rectal cancer performed over the last 10 years.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search of the following databases was conducted: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, and Scopus. Only articles published in English from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2018 (i.e. the last 10 years), which met inclusion criteria were considered. The review only included articles which compared Laparoscopic rectal resection (LRR) and Open Rectal Resection (ORR) for rectal cancer and reported at least one of the outcomes of interest. The analyses followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement checklist. Only prospective randomized studies were considered. The body of evidence emerging from this study was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Outcome measures (mean and median values, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges) were extracted for each surgical treatment. Pooled estimates of the mean differences were calculated using random effects models to consider potential inter-study heterogeneity and to adopt a more conservative approach. The pooled effect was considered significant if p <0.05.

RESULTS:
Five clinical trials were found eligible for the analyses. A positive involvement of CRM was found in 49 LRRs (8.5%) out of 574 patients and in 30 ORRs out of 557 patients (5.4%) RR was 1.55 (95% CI, 0.99-2.41; p = 0.05) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Incorrect mesorectal excision was observed in 56 out of 507 (11%) patients who underwent LRR and in 41 (8.4%) out of 484 patients who underwent ORR; RR was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.89-1.91; p = 0.18) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Regarding other pathologic outcomes, no significant difference between LRR and ORR was observed in the number of lymph nodes harvested or concerning the distance to the distal margin. As expected, a significant difference was found in the operating time for ORR with a mean difference of 41.99 (95% CI, 24.18, 59.81; p <0.00001; heterogeneity: I2 = 25%). However, no difference was found for blood loss. Additionally, no significant differences were found in postoperative outcomes such as postoperative hospital stay and postoperative complications. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as high.

CONCLUSION:
Despite the spread of laparoscopy with dedicated surgeons and the development of even more precise surgical tools and technologies, the pathological results of laparoscopic surgery are still comparable to those of open ones. Additionally, concerning the pathological data (and particularly CRM), open surgery guarantees better results as compared to laparoscopic surgery. These results must be a starting point for future evaluations which consider the association between ''successful resection"" and long-term oncologic outcomes. The introduction of other minimally invasive techniques for rectal cancer surgery, such as robotic resection or transanal TME (taTME), has revealed new scenarios and made open and even laparoscopic surgery obsolete.",To analyze pathologic and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic vs. open resections for rectal cancer performed over the last 10 years.,"A systematic literature search of the following databases was conducted: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, and Scopus.

endocrinology,endocrine tumors,Are immune-related adverse events associated with the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A number of studies have reported an association between the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical efficacy in patients undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the results remain controversial.

METHODS:
Under the guidance of a predefined protocol and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement, this meta-analysis included cohort studies investigating the association of irAEs and efficacy of ICIs in patients with cancer. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup analyses involving the cancer type, class of ICIs, combination therapy, sample size, model, landmark analysis, and approach used to extract the data were performed. Specific analyses of the type and grade of irAEs were also performed.

RESULTS:
This meta-analysis included 30 studies including 4971 individuals. Patients with cancer who developed irAEs experienced both an OS benefit and a PFS benefit from ICI therapy compared to patients who did not develop irAEs (OS: hazard ratio (HR), 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.65; pâ<â0.001; PFS: HR, 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44-0.61, pâ<Â 0.001). Subgroup analyses of the study quality characteristics and cancer types recapitulated these findings. Specific analyses of endocrine irAEs (OS: HR, 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44-0.62, pâ<Â 0.001), dermatological irAEs (OS: HR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.35-0.59, pâ<Â 0.001), and low-grade irAEs (OS: HR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.43-0.75; pâ<Â 0.001) yielded similar results. The association between irAE development and a favorable benefit on survival was significant in patients with cancer who were undergoing treatment with programmed cell death-1 inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.42-0.62; pâ<Â 0.001), but not cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.89, 95% CI, 0.49-1.61; pâ=â0.706). Additionally, the association was significant in patients with cancer who were treated with ICIs as a monotherapy (OS: HR, 0.53, 95% CI, 0.43-0.65; pâ<Â 0.001), but not as a combination therapy (OS: HR, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.36-1.05; pâ=â0.073).

CONCLUSIONS:
The occurrence of irAEs was significantly associated with a better ICI efficacy in patients with cancer, particularly endocrine, dermatological, and low-grade irAEs. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted to validate our findings.

endocrinology,obesity,Is prior bariatric surgery associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity is an independent risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but there is little evidence on whether prior bariatric surgery benefits the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. We aimed to summarize this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of current case-control studies.

METHODS:
We searched several electronic databases for case-control studies conducted between January 2020 and March 2022. We compared the rates of mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, dialysis, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay between COVID-19 patients with and without a history of bariatric surgery.

RESULTS:
We included six studies with 137â903 patients; 5270 (3.8%) had prior bariatric surgery, while 132â633 (96.2%) did not. COVID-19 patients with a history of bariatric surgery had significantly lower mortality (odds ratio (OR)â=â0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI)â=â0.23-0.74), ICU admission (ORâ=â0.48; 95% CIâ=â0.36-0.65), and mechanical ventilation rates than those with a history of non-bariatric surgery (ORâ=â0.51; 95% CIâ=â0.35-0.75).

CONCLUSIONS:
Prior bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of mortality and reduced severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity compared to those with no prior bariatric surgery. Further large-sample prospective studies are needed to support these results.

endocrinology,obesity,What Is the Efficacy of Short Length of Biliopancreatic Limb in One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Short-Term Results.,"OBJECTIVE:
To systematically review the efficacy of short length of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) in laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB).

METHODS:
By thoroughly investigating in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, each research containing the comparison between short BPL and 200-cm BPL was included, inception in July 2021. The research followed the guidance of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) recommendations.

RESULT:
A total of 1288 patients were included for meta-analysis. Results showed that in the short term, compared with 200-cm BPL, percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) did not show significant reduction (pâ=â0.91), neither did the incidence of vitamin D deficiency (pâ=â0.87) nor hypoalbuminemia (pâ=â0.06), while percentage total weight loss (%TWL) was significantly higher in the 200-cm BPL group (pâ=â0.0005).

endocrinology,thyroid disease,Does rituximab improve clinical outcomes of patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The current therapies of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) were still a challenging matter. In this study, we aimed to contrast the impact of before- after rituximab (RTX) therapy in the patients with TAO.

METHODS:
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases for articles published up to July 3, 2017. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was used to provide pooled estimates of standard mean difference (SMD) both the primary outcome from clinical activity score (CAS), and secondary outcomes from thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb), proptosis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. In addition, the quality and each study was assessed using either the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) or the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and reliability of the meta-analytic result using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

RESULTS:
Of the 839 articles initially searched, 11 studies were finally eligible for inclusion. Subgroup analysis results showed that comparing with initial value, there was a decline in CAS at 1,3,6,12Â month after RTX treatment, decreased TRAbs level at 6,12Â month, proptosis improvement at least 1Â month, unchanged IL-6 level at 6Â month, decreased TSH level at 3Â month but unchanged at 12Â month. All included studies were classified as good quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
The pooled data suggested that the preliminary effects of RTX treatment on TAO might be promising. However, more large-sample and high-quality studies targeting RTX use during this disease and long-term surveillance of prognosis are urgently needed.","The current therapies of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) were still a challenging matter.

family medicine,family medicine,What can family physicians offer patients with carpal tunnel syndrome other than surgery? A systematic review of nonsurgical management.,"BACKGROUND:
We undertook a literature review to produce evidence-based recommendations for nonsurgical family physician management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

METHODS:
Study design was systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CTS treatment. Data sources were English publications from all relevant databases, hand searches, and guidelines. Outcomes measured were nonsurgical management options for CTS.

RESULTS:
We assessed 2 systematic reviews, 16 RCTs, and 1 before-and-after study using historical controls. A considerable percentage of CTS resolves spontaneously. There is strong evidence that local corticosteroid injections, and to a lesser extent oral corticosteroids, give short-term relief for CTS sufferers. There is limited evidence to indicate that splinting, laser-acupuncture, yoga, and therapeutic ultrasound may be effective in the short to medium term (up to 6 months). The evidence for nerve and tendon gliding exercises is even more tentative. The evidence does not support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), chiropractic treatment, or magnet treatment.

CONCLUSIONS:
For those who are not able to get surgery or for those who do not want surgery, there are some conservative modalities that can be tried. These modalities include ones for which there is good evidence. It would be reasonable to try some of the techniques with less evidence if the better ones are not successful.

family medicine,adult procedures,What is the efficacy of aerobic exercise versus strength training in the treatment of migraine? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Multiple clinical trials with different exercise protocols have demonstrated efficacy in the management of migraine. However, there is no head-to-head comparison of efficacy between the different exercise interventions.

METHODS:
A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed involving all clinical trials which determined the efficacy of exercise interventions in reducing the frequency of monthly migraine. Medical journal search engines included Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus spanning all previous years up to July 30, 2022. Both aerobic and strength/resistance training protocols were included. The mean difference (MD, 95% confidence interval) in monthly migraine frequency from baseline to end-of-intervention between the active and control arms was used as an outcome measure. Efficacy evidence from direct and indirect comparisons was combined by conducting a random effects model network meta-analysis. The efficacy of the three exercise protocols was compared, i.e., moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise, and strength/resistance training. Studies that compared the efficacy of migraine medications (topiramate, amitriptyline) to exercise were included. Additionally, the risk of bias in all included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2).

RESULTS:
There were 21 published clinical trials that involved a total of 1195 migraine patients with a mean age of 35Â years and a female-to-male ratio of 6.7. There were 27 pairwise comparisons and 8 indirect comparisons. The rank of the interventions was as follows: strength training (MDâ=â-3.55 [-â6.15,â-â0.95]), high-intensity aerobic exercise (-3.13 [-5.28, -0.97]), moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (-2.18 [-3.25, -1.11]), topiramate (-0.98 [-4.16, 2.20]), placebo, amitriptyline (3.82 [-â1.03, 8.68]). The RoB2 assessment showed that 85% of the included studies demonstrated low risk of bias, while 15% indicated high risk of bias for intention-to-treat analysis. Sources of high risk of bias include randomization process and handling of missing outcome data.

CONCLUSION:
Strength training exercise regimens demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing migraine burden, followed by high-intensity aerobic exercise.","Multiple clinical trials with different exercise protocols have demonstrated efficacy in the management of migraine.

The rank of the interventions was as follows: strength training (MDâ=â-3.55 [-â6.15,â-â0.95]), high-intensity aerobic exercise (-3.13 [-5.28, -0.97]), moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (-2.18 [-3.25, -1.11]), topiramate (-0.98 [-4.16, 2.20]), placebo, amitriptyline (3.82 [-â1.03, 8.68]). The RoB2 assessment showed that 85% of the included studies demonstrated low risk of bias, while 15% indicated high risk of bias for intention-to-treat analysis. Sources of high risk of bias include randomization process and handling of missing outcome data.","Strength training exercise regimens demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing migraine burden, followed by high-intensity aerobic exercise.",36229774,"['31757169', '22136117', '22590713', '28017235', '21694556', '21694556', '26643584', '30203180', '30764753', '35366822', '18614890', '30485409', '31872062', '21890526', '25410451', '29161767', '29311997', '29208034', '33782057', '31462531', '31349391', '34598780', '34598780', '34598780', '29597198', '12971707', '35112219', '1555933', '12390609', '29333870', '19473281', '33206251', '21472632', '35751327', '29178659', '29368949', '7154893', '24853166', '31132869', '31813696', '28421374', '28421374', '28179394', '10701712', '15388533', '24148812', '18296435', '28722022', '22442371', '23314782', '20353780', '36029526', '32278976', '19515121', '22990628', '14984230', '31586135', '35962530', '28950996', '35304603', '29086504', '33997398', '35960105', '25010379', '29755363', '33369898', '34407642', '36017980', '32722936', '29504482']","['10.1177/0333102419889357', '10.1111/j.1468-1331.2011.03612.x', '10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.02061.x', '10.1016/j.jns.2016.11.071', '10.1249/MSS.0b013e318213fefb', '10.1249/MSS.0b013e318213fefb', '10.1111/head.12738', '10.1186/s10194-018-0902-y', '10.1186/s10194-019-0961-8', '10.1186/s12883-022-02650-0', '10.1097/JSM.0b013e31817efac9', '10.1111/head.13457', '10.1089/can.2018.0057', '10.1177/0333102411419681', '10.1590/0004-282X20140148', '10.1111/sms.13023', '10.3389/fphys.2017.01086', '10.1007/s11192-021-03948-5', '10.1186/s13643-017-0644-y', '10.1136/bmj.n71', '10.1136/bmj.l4898', '10.1002/jrsm.1373', '10.1016/j.neurol.2021.06.008', '10.1016/j.neurol.2021.06.008', '10.1016/j.neurol.2021.06.008', '10.1159/000487141', '10.1191/0269215503cr657oa', '10.1007/s10072-021-05843-6', '10.1111/j.1526-4610.1992.hed3201050.x', '10.1046/j.1526-4610.2002.02202.x', '10.1177/0333102417752119', '10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01448.x', '10.1007/s00421-020-04551-x', '10.1055/s-0030-1269928', '10.1007/s11332-021-00822-y', '10.1002/oby.22069', '10.1249/00005768-198205000-00012', '10.1177/0333102414535110', '10.1016/j.bjpt.2019.11.001', '10.1152/physrev.00034.2015', '10.2165/00007256-200029020-00002', '10.1136/bjsm.2004.011718', '10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.09.022', '10.1093/cercor/bhn013', '10.1038/npp.2017.148', '10.1242/jeb.063677', '10.1177/0333102412473372', '10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.03.029', '10.1093/brain/awac260', '10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108029', '10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01924.x', '10.1007/s00421-012-2495-5', '10.1046/j.1468-2982.2003.00624.x', '10.1038/s41582-019-0255-4', '10.1177/03331024221118924', '10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.09.008', '10.1038/s41574-022-00641-2', '10.1002/oby.21977', '10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06865', '10.1016/j.eclnm.2009.03.001', '10.1097/MD.0000000000029998', '10.11114/jets.v6i9a.3511', '10.1097/HCO.0000000000000097', '10.3389/fphys.2018.00403', '10.1177/03331024211029217', '10.1111/head.14380', '10.1177/0333102420941839', '10.1177/0333102418758283']",What is the efficacy of aerobic exercise versus strength training in the treatment of migraine?,10/17/2022,What is the efficacy of aerobic exercise versus strength training in the treatment of migraine?,"Strength training exercise regimens demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing migraine burden, followed by high-intensity aerobic exercise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
family medicine,adult procedures,What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:
The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.

METHODS:
Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively.

RESULTS:
A total of 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. In total, 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association.

CONCLUSIONS:
Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19-related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.",The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.,"Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020.

family medicine,anxiety disorders,What is the prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence in cancer survivors and patients? A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
Care for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is considered the most common unmet need among cancer survivors. Yet the prevalence of FCR and predisposing factors remain inconclusive. To support targeted care, we provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and severity of FCR among cancer survivors and patients, as measured using the short form of the validated Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI-SF). We also report on associations between FCR and clinical and demographic characteristics.

METHODS:
This is a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis on the prevalence of FCR. In the review, we included all studies that used the FCRI-SF with adult (â¥18Â years) cancer survivors and patients. Date of search: 7 February 2020. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool.

RESULTS:
IPD were requested from 87 unique studies and provided for 46 studies comprising 11,226 participants from 13 countries. 9311 respondents were included for the main analyses. On the FCRI-SF (range 0-36), 58.8% of respondents scored â¥13, 45.1% scored â¥16 and 19.2% scored â¥22. FCR decreased with age and women reported more FCR than men. FCR was found across cancer types and continents and for all time periods since cancer diagnosis.

CONCLUSIONS:
FCR affects a considerable number of cancer survivors and patients. It is therefore important that healthcare providers discuss this issue with their patients and provide treatment when needed. Further research is needed to investigate how best to prevent and treat FCR and to identify other factors associated with FCR. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42020142185).","Care for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is considered the most common unmet need among cancer survivors.

family medicine,breast cancer,Can serum autoantibodies be a potential early detection biomarker for breast cancer in women? A diagnostic test accuracy review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The increasing incidence of breast cancer necessitates the need to explore alternate screening strategies that circumvent the setbacks of conventional techniques especially among population that report earlier age at diagnosis. Serum autoantibodies is one such potential area of interest. However, their ubiquitous presence across cancer types limits its applicability to any one specific type of cancer. This review was therefore carried out to explore and consolidate available evidence on autoantibodies for early detection of breast cancer and to identify those that demonstrated a higher sensitivity.

METHODS:
A diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) review was carried out to ascertain serum autoantibodies that could be used for early detection of breast cancer among women. All relevant articles that investigated the role of autoantibodies in early detection of breast cancer were included for the review. MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Ovid SP, and Cochrane Library were searched extensively for eligible studies. Quality of the included studies was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. RevMan 5.3 was used for exploratory and MetaDTA 2019 for hierarchical analyses. The review helped identify the most frequently investigated autoantibodies and a meta-analysis further consolidated the findings.

RESULTS:
A total of 53 articles were included for the final analysis that reported over a 100 autoantibodies that were studied for early detection of breast cancer in women. P53, MUC1, HER2, HSP60, P16, Cyclin B1, and c-Myc were the most frequently investigated autoantibodies. Of these P53, MUC1, HER2, and HSP60 exhibited higher summary sensitivity measures. While the individual pooled sensitivity estimates ranged between 10 and 56%, the panel sensitivity values reported across studies were higher with an estimated range of 60-87%.

CONCLUSION:
Findings from the review indicate a higher sensitivity for an autoantibody panel in comparison to individual assays. A panel comprising of P53, MUC1, HER2, and HSP60 autoantibodies has the potential to be investigated as an early detection biomarker for breast cancer.","The increasing incidence of breast cancer necessitates the need to explore alternate screening strategies that circumvent the setbacks of conventional techniques especially among population that report earlier age at diagnosis.

family medicine,breast cancer,"Does Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radiotherapy have a Better Survival than Mastectomy? A Meta-Analysis of More than 1,500,000 Patients.","BACKGROUND:
There have been conflicting studies reporting on survival advantages between breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapyÂ (BCS) in comparison with mastectomy. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of BCS and mastectomy in terms of overall survival (OS) comparing all past published studies.

METHODS:
We performed a comprehensive review of literature through October 2021 in PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE. The studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts that compare BCS versus mastectomy. We excluded studies that included male sex, stage 0, distant metastasis at diagnosis, bilateral synchronous cancer, neoadjuvant radiation/chemotherapy, and articles with incomplete data. We performed a meta-analysis following the random-effect model with the inverse variance method.

RESULTS:
From 18,997 publications, a total of 30 studies were included in the final analysis: 6 studies were randomized trials, and 24 were retrospective cohorts. A total of 1,802,128 patients with a follow-up ranging from 4 to 20 years were included, and 1,075,563 and 744,565 underwent BCS and mastectomy, respectively. Among the population, BCS is associated with improved OS compared with mastectomy [relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.74]. This effect was similar when analysis was performed in cohorts and multi-institutional databases (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49-0.67). Furthermore, the benefit of BCS was stronger in patients who had less than 10 years of follow-up (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46-0.64).

CONCLUSIONS:
Patients who underwent BCS had better OS compared with mastectomy. Such results depicting survival advantage, especially using such a large sample of patients, may need to be included in the shared surgical decision making when discussing breast cancer treatment with patients.",There have been conflicting studies reporting on survival advantages between breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapyÂ (BCS) in comparison with mastectomy.

family medicine,child and adolescent mental disorders,What Role for Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics in Managing Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders in Children and Adolescents? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIAs) are an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment in adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, there is less evidence for their use in children and adolescents.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim of this systematic review was to summarize findings regarding the effectiveness and side effects of LAIA in children and adolescents with SSD.

METHODS:
Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDES, and Dialnet) were systematically searched for articles published between inception and 12 March, 2022, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) original articles or case reports; (2) providing data on efficacy/effectiveness or safety/tolerability of LAIA treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with SSD (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, non-affective psychotic disorder); (3) mean age of samples â¤â18 years; and (4) written in English or Spanish. Exclusion criteria were review articles, clinical guides, expert consensus as well as posters or oral communication in conferences. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS tool.

RESULTS:
From 847 articles found, 13 met the inclusion criteria. These included seven single case reports or case series, four retrospective chart reviews, a 24-week open-label trial, and one observational prospective study, covering a total of 119 adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with SSD. Almost all the articles described data on second-generation LAIA (53 patients on risperidone [once every other week], 33 on paliperidone palmitate [once monthly], 10 on aripiprazole [once monthly], and two on olanzapine pamoate [once monthly]). Twenty-one patients were reported to be only on first-generation LAIAs. Non-adherence was the main reason for starting an LAIA. In all of the studies, the use of LAIAs was associated with improvement in the patients' symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS:
There are few studies assessing the use of LAIAs in adolescents with SSD. Overall, these treatments have suggested good effectiveness and acceptable safety and tolerability. However, we found no studies examining their use in children aged <â12 years. The problems and benefits linked to this type of antipsychotic formulation in the child and adolescent population require further study, ideally with prospective, controlled designs.",The aim of this systematic review was to summarize findings regarding the effectiveness and side effects of LAIA in children and adolescents with SSD.,"Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDES, and Dialnet) were systematically searched for articles published between inception and 12 March, 2022, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) original articles or case reports; (2) providing data on efficacy/effectiveness or safety/tolerability of LAIA treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with SSD (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, non-affective psychotic disorder); (3) mean age of samples â¤â18 years; and (4) written in English or Spanish.

family medicine,child and adolescent mental disorders,"What are the barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking behaviours for common mental health problems in adolescents? A systematic review.","BACKGROUND:
Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern. Teens who are most in need of mental health attention are reluctant to seek help. A better understanding of the help-seeking in this population is needed to overcome this gap.

METHODS:
Five databases were searched to identify the principal barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking for common mental health problems in adolescents aged 10-19âyears. The search was performed in June 2018 and updated in April 2019. Two independent screening processes were made using the eligibility criteria. Quality assessment of each study was performed, and findings summarised using a narrative synthesis.

RESULTS:
Ninety studies meet the inclusion criteria for this review for barrier and facilitators (nâ=â54) and interventions (nâ=â36). Stigma and negative beliefs towards mental health services and professionals were the most cited barriers. Facilitators included previous positive experience with health services and mental health literacy. Most interventions were based on psychoeducation, which focused on general mental health knowledge, suicide and self-harm, stigma and depression. Other types of interventions included the use of multimedia and online tools, peer training and outreach initiatives. Overall, the quality of studies was low to medium and there was no general agreement regarding help-seeking definition and measurements.

CONCLUSION:
Most of the interventions took place in an educational setting however, it is important to consider adolescents outside the educational system. Encouraging help-seeking should come with the increased availability of mental health support for all adolescents in need, but this is still a major challenge for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. There is also a need to develop shared definitions, theoretical frameworks and higher methodological standards in research regarding help-seeking behaviours in adolescents. This will allow more consistency and generalisability of findings, improving the development of help-seeking interventions and ensuring timely access to mental health treatments.",Increasing rates of mental health problems among adolescents are of concern.

family medicine,depressive disorders,"Is transcranial direct current stimulation, alone or in combination with antidepressant medications or psychotherapies, effective in treating major depressive disorder? A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND:
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown mixed results for depression treatment. The efficacies of tDCS combination therapies have not been investigated deliberately. This review aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of tDCS as a monotherapy and in combination with medication, psychotherapy, and ECT for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and identified the factors influencing treatment outcome measures (i.e. depression score, dropout, response, and remission rates).

METHODS:
The systematic review was performed in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Sciences, and OpenGrey. Two authors performed independent literature screening and data extraction. The primary outcomes were the standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous depression scores after treatment and odds ratio (OR) dropout rate; secondary outcomes included ORs for response and remission rates. Random effects models with 95% confidence intervals were employed in all outcomes. The overall effect of tDCS was investigated by meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were explored via subgroup analyses, meta-regression, sensitivity analyses, and assessment of publication bias.

RESULTS:
Twelve randomised, sham-controlled trials (active group: Nâ=â251, sham group: Nâ=â204) were included. Overall, the integrated depression score of the active group after treatment was significantly lower than that of the sham group (gâ=â-â0.442, pâ=â0.017), and further analysis showed that only tDCS + medication achieved a significant lower scoreÂ (gâ=â-â0.855, p <â0.001). Moreover, this combination achieved a significantly higher response rate than sham intervention (ORâ=â2.7, pâ=â0.006), while the response rate remained unchanged for the other three therapies. Dropout and remission rates were similar in the active and sham groups for each therapy and also for the overall intervention. The meta-regression results showed that current intensity is the only predictor for the response rate. None of publication bias was identified.

CONCLUSION:
The effect size of tDCS treatment was obviously larger in depression score compared with sham stimulation. The tDCS combined selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors is the optimized therapy that is effective on depression score and response rate. tDCS monotherapy and combined psychotherapy have no significant effects. The most important parameter for optimization in future trials is treatment strategy.","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown mixed results for depression treatment.

family medicine,depressive disorders,Is there any association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular opportunistic parasite that is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. This parasite accounts for mental disorders; however, the relationship between T. gondii infection and depressive disorder is unclear. Regarding this, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the scientific evidence regarding the potential association between major depression disorder (MDD) and Toxoplasma infection.

METHODS:
For the purpose of the study, the articles related to the subject of interest were systematically searched in seven electronic databases. Special attention was given to the studies examining T. gondii seropositivity level in depressed patients and controls.

RESULTS:
The search process resulted in the identification of a total of 30 publications meeting the inclusion criteria and published up to April 2018 for the systematic review. Furthermore, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria to be entered into meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis involved the review of cross-sectional studies including 1657 depressed patients and 19565 individuals as controls and case-control studies entailing 1311 depressed cases and 6015 controls without depression. 1582 depressed people participated in cross-sectional studies whose results were reported as odds ratio (OR). In addition, the total number of participants was 15068 in this type of studies. Statistical analysis indicated that the pooled OR of the risk of anti-T. gondii IgG antibody in depressed individuals in case-control and cross-sectional studies was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.39).

CONCLUSIONS:
As the findings of the reviewed articles indicated, toxoplasmosis is not a risk factor for MDD. However, it is necessary to perform further research to clarify the detailed association between T. gondii and dysthymia or mild and moderate depression. Furthermore, it is recommended to better investigate the effect of antibody titers on the relationship between depression and T. gondii infection.","Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular opportunistic parasite that is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis.

family medicine,eating disorders,Is cultural change associated with eating disorders? A systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
There is debate as to whether the development of an eating disorder (ED) may be triggered by acculturation to Western culture. While there is evidence to suggest that acculturation to Western culture is associated with risk of having an ED, these findings are limited, vary significantly, and are sometimes conflicting.

AIMS:
To review the literature and empirical data on the association between ED symptoms and acculturation in the context of Western culture.

METHODS:
A systematic search of peer-reviewed publications using a combination of the keywords ""Culture"", ""Acculturation"" and ""Eating disorders"" was first performed in August 2014 and updated in February 2015 with the following databases: PubMed and SCOPUS. Reference lists were also hand searched. In total, the search provided more than 50 studies. Following screening (as stated in the PRISMA guidelines) of the titles and abstracts by inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment of the full text, 25 studies were identified to be appropriate for the review. Articles were examined in relation to the findings, as well as the ED and acculturation measures used.

RESULTS:
Eleven studies suggested considerable association between ED and culture change/acculturation. Six studies suggested little or no association between ED and culture change/acculturation. Eight studies did not primarily examine association, yet generated valuable insight. While there was relative consistency across studies in terms of the ED measures selected, measures of acculturation varied significantly.

CONCLUSIONS:
The majority of the evidence reviewed here suggests that there is a substantial association between culture change and ED psychopathology. However, both greater and lesser acculturation have been identified as risk factors for the development of an ED, and this varies depending on the group studied as well as how acculturation and culture change are conceptualized and measured. Further research is warranted to form cross-culturally acceptable definitions and measures of problematic eating, and healthy and high acculturation, to study the relationship between EDs and the process of acculturation to Western culture.","There is debate as to whether the development of an eating disorder (ED) may be triggered by acculturation to Western culture.

family medicine,genetic diseases in children,Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem that has major implications for the welfare of the child involved. Unexplained fractures are of particular concern to the orthopaedic surgeon, who must often consider alternative diagnoses to CAN.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
We therefore (1) determined which bone diseases most commonly mimic CAN; (2) what types of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are most commonly confused with CAN and why; and (3) what specific findings in OI and bone disease render a mistaken diagnosis of CAN more likely.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was performed. We identified studies that compared cases of CAN with cases in which patients had bone disease that resulted in an unexplained fracture. We also included studies in which patients with fractures resulting from underlying bony pathology were misclassified as CAN and were subsequently reclassified as bone disease as a result of further investigation. Our search netted only five studies that directly compared and contrasted CAN with metabolic or genetic bone disease in the same study.

RESULTS:
The published literature suggests OI is most frequently confused with CAN, although metaphyseal dysplasia, disorders of phosphate metabolism, and temporary brittle bone disease are also documented in the literature identified by our search. Difficulty in differentiating these bony diseases from CAN stems from ambiguity in the history and physical examination at the time of presentation.

CONCLUSIONS:
Bone disease is a diagnosis of exclusion in the differential diagnosis of CAN.","Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem that has major implications for the welfare of the child involved.

family medicine,gynecologic oncology,Adjuvant therapy in early-stage cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy: are we overtreating our patients? A meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
There is a gap in knowledge regarding the ideal management of patients with early-stage cervical cancer and intermediate-risk features. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the published literature on oncological outcomes in these patients and determine trends in postoperative management.

METHODS:
MEDLINE and PubMed were used for literature searches. The inclusion criteria were: English language articles including â¥ 10 patients, patients who underwent radical hysterectomy, nodes negative, studies reporting oncological outcomes and complications treatment-related and compare a surgery-only cohort with a radiotherapy cohort. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Combined relative risk was calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model and a forest plot was drawn.

RESULTS:
We collected 183 manuscripts on early-stage cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy alone or with adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery. A total of eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Regarding oncological outcomes, survival was reported in five studies. The relative risk of recurrence and the relative risk of mortality was similar in both groups independently whether receive or not adjuvant therapy. Most of the studies did not report significant differences regarding morbidity treatment related between the groups, except for a higher rate of lymphedema after radiotherapy.

CONCLUSION:
We found that the relative risk of recurrence and mortality was similar in both groups not depending on adjuvant therapy. Therefore, whether radiotherapy adjuvant treatment is indicated remains a topic of debate.","There is a gap in knowledge regarding the ideal management of patients with early-stage cervical cancer and intermediate-risk features.

family medicine,gynecologic oncology,Better or worse? The prognostic role of the mesenchymal subtype in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Tumor characteristics can be prognostically relevant in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). This study aimed to determine whether different subtypes of HGSOC, especially the mesenchymal subtype, are associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with HGSOC.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published up to September 2020. The eligibility criteria were (1) population: patients with HGSOG with molecular subtyping of their tumor, (2) exposure: mesenchymal subtype, (3) non-exposure: differentiated, immunoreactive, proliferative, and other non-mesenchymal subtypes, (4) outcome: survival, with hazard ratios (HRs), and (5) English language.

RESULTS:
The mesenchymal subtype showed no statistically significant difference in OS compared with the immunoreactive subtype (HRÂ =Â 1.47, 95% CI: 0.78-2.78, pÂ =Â 0.238; I<sup>2</sup> Â =â81.2%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub> Â =Â 0.005) or all non-mesenchymal subtypes (HRÂ =Â 1.65, 95% CI: 0.97-2.80, pÂ =Â 0.063; I<sup>2</sup> Â =â79.4%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub> Â =Â 0.008). The mesenchymal subtype showed no statistically significant difference in PFS compared with the immunoreactive subtype (HRÂ =Â 1.19, 95% CI: 0.71-2.00, pÂ =Â 0.514; I<sup>2</sup> Â =â71.6%, p<sub>heterogeneity</sub> Â =Â 0.030) but a significant differences was observed when using all non-mesenchymal subtypes as reference (HRÂ =Â 1.51, 95% CI: 1.00-2.28, pÂ =Â 0.049). The results were robust according to the sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS:
There are no statistically significant differences in OS between the mesenchymal subtype of HGSOC and other subtypes of HGSOC. Because of statistical power, this meta-analysis cannot conclude about non-inferiority, and the relationship between the molecular subtypes and HGSOC prognosis remains controversial. Based on one study, the mesenchymal subtype could have a poorer PFS than the non-mesenchymal subtypes of HGSOC, but this conclusion requires further evidence.","Tumor characteristics can be prognostically relevant in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC).

family medicine,gynecologic oncology,Does coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> supplementation improve fertility outcomes in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE:
Increased oxidative stress has been identified as a pathogenetic mechanism in female infertility. However, the effect of specific antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), on the outcomes after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the best available evidence regarding the effect of CoQ<sub>10</sub> supplementation on clinical pregnancy (CPR), live birth (LBR), and miscarriage rates (MR) compared with placebo or no-treatment in women with infertility undergoing ART.

METHODS:
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane, and Scopus, from inception to March 2020. Data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The I<sup>2</sup> index was employed for heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
Five randomized-controlled trials fulfilled eligibility criteria (449 infertile women; 215 in CoQ<sub>10</sub> group and 234 in placebo/no treatment group). Oral supplementation of CoQ<sub>10</sub> resulted in an increase of CPR when compared with placebo or no-treatment (28.8% vs. 14.1%, respectively; OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.30-4.59, p = 0.006; I<sup>2</sup> 32%). This effect remained significant when women with poor ovarian response and polycystic ovarian syndrome were analyzed separately. No difference between groups was observed regarding LBR (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66-4.25, p = 0.28; I<sup>2</sup> 34%) and MR (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.81, p = 0.52; I<sup>2</sup> 0%).

CONCLUSIONS:
Oral supplementation of CoQ<sub>10</sub> may increase CPR when compared with placebo or no-treatment, in women with infertility undergoing ART procedures, without an effect on LBR or MR.","Increased oxidative stress has been identified as a pathogenetic mechanism in female infertility.

family medicine,infections and infestations,Is hybrid therapy more efficient in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
Hybrid therapy (HT) is a non-bismuth quadruple therapy created to surpass Helicobacter pylori's (H. pylori) resistance rates to antibiotics. HT has excellent eradication rates, as well as a very good compliance and safety profile. We aim to compare HT with sequential therapy (ST) and concomitant therapy (CT) for the eradication of H. pylori.

METHODS:
This systematic review was conducted following the principles of the PRISMA guidelines. Literature was electronically searched on the CENTRAL library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The primary outcome evaluated was eradication rate of H. pylori. The secondary outcomes evaluated were adverse events and compliance rates. Meta-analyses were performed with Cochrane Review Manager 5.4. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate the pooled relative risk and 95% confidence interval of the eradication rates between HT and other regimens, as well as the secondary outcomes.

RESULTS:
10 studies were included, comprising 2993 patients. The mean eradication rates achieved by HT with intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were, respectively, 86% (range: 79.2-90.8%) and 91.7% (range: 82.6-96.1%). No statistically significant difference was found in ITT eradication rate between HT and CT (relative risk: 1; 95% CI: 0.96- 1.03) and between HT and ST (relative risk: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.92-1.14). PP analysis revealed similar results. HT was associated with higher compliance rates than CT and slightly lower than ST. As far as adverse events are concerned, this meta-analysis demonstrated a higher occurrence of adverse events on the group of patients treated with CT when compared with HT. HT and ST showed similar results.

CONCLUSION:
HT has similar eradication, compliance and adverse event rates when compared to ST, but a better safety profile than the CT.","Hybrid therapy (HT) is a non-bismuth quadruple therapy created to surpass Helicobacter pylori's (H. pylori) resistance rates to antibiotics.

family medicine,infections and infestations,Does vitamin D reduce the mortality rate of Plasmodium infection?: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Vitamin D supplementation is recommended as an effective adjunct to counteract malaria pathogenesis, but the evidence on this point is limited and controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D administration on the survival rate of Plasmodium-infected animals in experimentally-induced malaria on days 6 and 10 post-infection.

METHODS:
Five electronic databases were searched up to 20 December 2021. The pooled risks ratio (RR) and associated 95% confidence interval were estimated using the Restricted-maximum likelihood (REML) random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> value. Sub-group analyses were used to identify the sources of heterogeneity for several variables, such as type of vitamin D, type of intervention, and dose of vitamin D.

RESULTS:
Out of 248 articles found in the electronic database, six were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The current study found that the pooled random effect of risks ratio favored a statistically significant effect of vitamin D administration on survival rate in infected mice on day 6 post Plasmodium infection (RRâ=â1.08, 95%CI 1.03, 1.15, pâ<â0.99; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%). It also found that vitamin D administration significantly affected the survival rate on day 10 post-infection (RRâ=â1.94, 95%CI 1.39, 2.71, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â69.02%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant pooled RRs of the positive effect of vitamin D administration for cholecalciferol (RRâ=â3.11, 95%CI 2.41, 4.03, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%), doses higher than 50Â Âµg/kg (RRâ=â3.37, 95%CI 2.55, 4.27, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%), and oral administration (RRâ=â3.01, 95%CI 2.37, 3.82, pâ<â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â0%).

CONCLUSION:
This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that vitamin D administration positively affects the survival rate in Plasmodium-infected mice. Since, the mouse model may not accurately reproduce the clinical and pathological features of human malaria, future research should investigate the impact of vitamin D in human malaria.","Vitamin D supplementation is recommended as an effective adjunct to counteract malaria pathogenesis, but the evidence on this point is limited and controversial.

family medicine,infections and infestations,Is It Really the Foley? A Systematic Review of Bladder Management and Infection Risk.,"BACKGROUND:
The belief that intermittent catheterization results in fewer infections than indwelling catheters is commonly expressed in the spinal cord injury literature. Some practice guidelines strongly recommend intermittent over indwelling catheterization due to concerns about infections and other complications. However, studies on this topic are of low quality. Guidelines from the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine suggest the data regarding infection risk are mixed, and they do not recommend one bladder management method over the other.

OBJECTIVES:
To compare risk of bias in studies reporting higher rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) with indwelling catheters to studies that found equal rates of UTI between indwelling and intermittent catheterization, and to describe implications in clinical decision-making.

METHODS:
A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS databases from January 1, 1980, to September 15, 2020, was conducted. Eligible studies compared symptomatic UTI rates between indwelling and intermittent catheterization. We used a risk of bias assessment tool to evaluate each study.

RESULTS:
Twenty-four studies were identified. Only three of these reported significantly higher UTI risk with indwelling catheters, and all three demonstrated a critical risk of bias. More than half of the studies reported differences in UTI risk of less than 20% between the two methods. Studies with larger (nonsignificant) differences favoring intermittent catheterization were more susceptible to bias from confounding.

CONCLUSION:
The hypothesis that indwelling catheters cause more UTIs than intermittent catheterization is not supported by the scientific literature. Most studies failed to demonstrate a significant difference in UTI risk, and studies with nonsignificant trends favoring intermittent catheterization were more susceptible to bias from confounding. Perceived risk of infection should not influence a patient's choice of catheter type.","To compare risk of bias in studies reporting higher rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) with indwelling catheters to studies that found equal rates of UTI between indwelling and intermittent catheterization, and to describe implications in clinical decision-making.","A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS databases from January 1, 1980, to September 15, 2020, was conducted.

family medicine,labor and delivery,Does the Finnish intervention prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries? A systematic review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVES:
A rise in obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) has been observed and a preventive approach, originating in Finland, has been introduced in several European hospitals. The aim of this paper was to systematically evaluate the evidence behind the 'Finnish intervention'.

DESIGN:
A systematic review of the literature conducted according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

OUTCOME MEASURES:
The primary outcome was OASIS. Secondary outcomes were (perinatal): Apgar scores, pH and standard base excess in the umbilical cord, and (maternal): episiotomy, intact perineum, first and second-degree perineal lacerations, duration of second stage, birth position and women's perceptions/birth experiences.

METHODS:
Multiple databases (Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed and SveMed) were systematically searched for studies published up to December 2014. Both randomised controlled trials and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if a full-text article was not available. Studies were evaluated by use of international reporting guidelines (eg, STROBE).

RESULTS:
Overall, 1042 articles were screened and 65 retrieved for full-text evaluation. Seven studies, all observational and with a level of evidence at 2c or lower, were included and consistently reported a significant reduction in OASIS. All evaluated episiotomy and found a significant increase. Three studies evaluated perinatal outcomes and reported conflicting results. No study reported on other perineal outcomes, duration of the second stage, birth positions or women's perceptions.

CONCLUSIONS:
A reduction in OASIS has been contributed to the Finnish intervention in seven observational studies, all with a low level of evidence. Knowledge about the potential perinatal and maternal side effects and women's perceptions of the intervention is extremely limited and the biological mechanisms underlying the Finnish intervention are not well documented. Studies with a high level of evidence are needed to assess the effects of the intervention before implementation in clinical settings can be recommended.","A rise in obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) has been observed and a preventive approach, originating in Finland, has been introduced in several European hospitals.

family medicine,laboratory medicine,Do patients with and survivors of COVID-19 benefit from telerehabilitation? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) significantly impacts physical, psychological, and social functioning and reduces quality of life, which may persist for at least 6 months. Given the fact that COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease and therefore healthcare facilities may be sources of contagion, new methods avoiding face-to-face contact between healthcare workers and patients are urgently needed. Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services to patients at a distance <i>via</i> information and communication technologies. However, high-quality evidence of the efficacy of telerehabilitation for COVID-19 is still lacking. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of telerehabilitation for patients with and survivors of COVID-19.

METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline (<i>via</i> PubMed), PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2022 for randomized controlled trials published in English, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation vs. face-to-face rehabilitation, usual care, or no treatment for COVID-19. Methodological quality and overall evidence quality of the included studies were assessed. The statistical reliability of the data was quantified using the trial sequential analysis.

RESULTS:
Seven randomized controlled trials with eight comparisons were included and all of them were used for meta-analysis. The meta-analyses of absolute values showed the superiority of telerehabilitation over no treatment or usual care for dyspnea (Borg scale: mean difference = -1.88, -2.37 to -1.39; Multidimensional dyspnea-12: mean difference = -3.70, -5.93 to -1.48), limb muscle strength (mean difference = 3.29; 2.12 to 4.47), ambulation capacity (standardized mean difference = 0.88; 0.62 to 1.14), and depression (mean difference = -5.68; -8.62 to -2.74). Significant improvement in these variables persisted in the meta-analyses of change scores. No significant difference was found in anxiety and quality of life. No severe adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.

CONCLUSIONS:
Moderate- to very low-quality evidence demonstrates that telerehabilitation may be an effective and safe solution for patients with and survivors of COVID-19 in dyspnea, lower limb muscle strength, ambulation capacity, and depression. Further well-designed studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects, cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction in larger samples.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) significantly impacts physical, psychological, and social functioning and reduces quality of life, which may persist for at least 6 months. Given the fact that COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease and therefore healthcare facilities may be sources of contagion, new methods avoiding face-to-face contact between healthcare workers and patients are urgently needed. Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services to patients at a distance <i>via</i> information and communication technologies. However, high-quality evidence of the efficacy of telerehabilitation for COVID-19 is still lacking. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of telerehabilitation for patients with and survivors of COVID-19.","We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline (<i>via</i> PubMed), PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2022 for randomized controlled trials published in English, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation vs. face-to-face rehabilitation, usual care, or no treatment for COVID-19. Methodological quality and overall evidence quality of the included studies were assessed. The statistical reliability of the data was quantified using the trial sequential analysis.","Seven randomized controlled trials with eight comparisons were included and all of them were used for meta-analysis. The meta-analyses of absolute values showed the superiority of telerehabilitation over no treatment or usual care for dyspnea (Borg scale: mean difference = -1.88, -2.37 to -1.39; Multidimensional dyspnea-12: mean difference = -3.70, -5.93 to -1.48), limb muscle strength (mean difference = 3.29; 2.12 to 4.47), ambulation capacity (standardized mean difference = 0.88; 0.62 to 1.14), and depression (mean difference = -5.68; -8.62 to -2.74). Significant improvement in these variables persisted in the meta-analyses of change scores. No significant difference was found in anxiety and quality of life. No severe adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.","Moderate- to very low-quality evidence demonstrates that telerehabilitation may be an effective and safe solution for patients with and survivors of COVID-19 in dyspnea, lower limb muscle strength, ambulation capacity, and depression.

family medicine,laboratory medicine,Is chorioamnionitis associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants? A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA.,"BACKGROUND:
The relationships between chorioamnionitis (CA) and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants remain controversial. The meta-analysis aims to evaluate the associations between CA and neurodevelopmental deficits in preterm infants.

METHODS:
All studies exploring the associations between CA and neurodevelopmental deficits in preterm infants were retrieved from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, OVID, EBSCO, ProQuest, CDSR, and CENTRAL. The NOS was used to evaluate the quality of the studies, RevMan was adopted to analyze the data.

RESULTS:
Twelve studies involving 4267 preterm infants were included. The ORs across studies was 0.95 (Pâ=â.77, Iâ=â51%) for cognitive deficits, 1.09 (Pâ=â.44, Iâ=â10%) for psychomotor deficits, 1.21 (Pâ=â.08, Iâ=â25%) for language deficits, 2.34 (Pâ=â.02, Iâ=â0%) for performance intelligence quotient impairment and 2.81 (Pâ=â.03, Iâ=â0%) for verbal intelligence quotient impairment. Subgroup analyses based on the severity of cognitive deficits indicated that CA might be correlated with severe cognitive deficits (Pâ=â.01, Iâ=â0%) but not with mild cognitive deficits (Pâ=â.40, Iâ=â19%). In terms of the CA category, clinical CA may be related to overall psychomotor deficits (Pâ=â.01, Iâ=â25%) and overall language deficits (Pâ<â.00001, Iâ=â23%) other than histological CA.

family medicine,laboratory medicine,Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Many studies have investigated whether pleural cholesterol levels can aid in diagnosis of pleural exudates, and the results have varied considerably. To gain a more reliable answer to this question, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol or the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) as diagnostic tests to help identify pleural exudates.

METHODS:
Literature databases were systematically searched for studies examining accuracy of pleural cholesterol or P/S cholesterol ratios for diagnosing pleural exudates. Data on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using bivariate-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to summarize overall test performance.

RESULTS:
Our meta-analysis included up to 20 studies involving 3,496 subjects. Summary estimates for pleural cholesterol in the diagnosis of pleural exudates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.88 (95%CI 0.84 to 0.92); specificity, 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98); PLR, 20.31 (95% CI 11.21 to 36.78); NLR, 0.12 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.17); DOR, 167.06 (95% CI 76.79 to 363.95); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98). The corresponding summary performance estimates for using the P/S cholesterol ratio were as follows: sensitivity, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96); specificity, 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.91); PLR 7.46 (95% CI, 5.47 to 10.19); NLR, 0.07 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.10); DOR, 107.74 (95% CI 60.91 to 190.60); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98).

CONCLUSIONS:
Both pleural cholesterol level and the P/S cholesterol ratio are helpful for the diagnosis of pleural exudates. Nevertheless, the results of pleural cholesterol assays should be interpreted in parallel with the results of traditional tests and clinical information.","Many studies have investigated whether pleural cholesterol levels can aid in diagnosis of pleural exudates, and the results have varied considerably.

family medicine,pediatric oncology,How Should We Treat Pancreatic Metastases from Renal Cell Carcinoma? A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The treatment strategy for pancreatic metastasis (PM) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear due to its rarity. The aim of this study was to reveal the role of surgery for PM from RCC.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The effectiveness of surgery for PM was evaluated based on the primary outcome of overall survival (OS), which was investigated in relation to surgical procedures and metastatic sites via subgroup analyses.

RESULTS:
There was no significant difference in the rate of 2-year OS between the surgery and control group (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.14-1.26, Pâ=â0.12). However, the rate of 5-year OS was significantly higher in the surgery group than the control group (ORâ=â0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.93, Pâ=â0.03). The rates of the complications and OS were not significantly different between radical and conservative pancreatectomies. The rate of 5-year OS of the patients with PM was higher than that with other metastases (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.74, Pâ=â0.004).

family medicine,pediatric oncology,Do statins play any role in reducing the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between statin consumption and risk of incidence of ovarian cancer (OC) and associated mortality.

METHODS:
Computerized searches were conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus). Two calibrated authors performed the publications selection, data extraction, and quality assessment of the selected publications. The quality of the included articles was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies, and Jadad criteria for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The electronic searches retrieved 2272 titles/abstracts. After the deletion of duplicate publications, 2030 titles/abstracts were assessed. Eighteen articles were included.

RESULTS:
Meta-analysis demonstrated that risk ratio (RR) of the association between statin consumption and OC incidence was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.75-1.03, P = 0.109). Patients receiving statin were less likely to die than those who did not receive statin, with a statistically significant association [RR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, P = 0.0001)]. There was no evidence of publication bias in examining the association between statin consumption and the risk of incidence and mortality from OC.

CONCLUSIONS:
This study determined that statin use reduced the incidence risk of OC and significantly increased the survival in OC patients.",This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between statin consumption and risk of incidence of ovarian cancer (OC) and associated mortality.,"Computerized searches were conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus).

family medicine,pediatric sleep disorders,Are obstructive sleep apnea and sleep improved in response to multidisciplinary weight loss interventions in youth with obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Pediatric obesity is closely associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and short sleep duration. While multidisciplinary weight loss interventions are recommended for pediatric obesity management, the evidence for their effects on OSA severity and overall sleep in youth have not been systematically examined.

OBJECTIVES:
To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effects of multidisciplinary weight loss interventions on OSA severity and prevalence, and on overall sleep health in youth with obesity.

METHODS:
A systematic search of interventional studies (participants age range: 10-19âyrs) was performed using PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase, from inception to May 2019. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

RESULTS:
Ten studies were included by the end of the screening process. Ninety percent of the included studies reported a decrease in OSA prevalence post-intervention, and OSA was normalized for 46.2-79.7% of the youth. The meta-analysis comprising seven longitudinal studies revealed significant reductions in apnea-hypopnea index (effect size: -0.51, 95%CI -0.94 to -0.08, pâ=â0.019), and oxygen desaturation index (effect size: -0.28, 95%CIâ=â-0.50 to -0.05, pâ=â0.016). Seventy-five percent of the studies reported improved sleep duration in youth with OSA.

CONCLUSIONS:
Evidence suggests that multidisciplinary weight loss interventions result in improvements in OSA severity and sleep duration in youth with obesity. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to better assess and understand the independent implications of weight loss, fat mass decrease and chronic exercise on OSA and sleep health in this population.","To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effects of multidisciplinary weight loss interventions on OSA severity and prevalence, and on overall sleep health in youth with obesity.","A systematic search of interventional studies (participants age range: 10-19âyrs) was performed using PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase, from inception to May 2019.

family medicine,pregnancy complications,Does vaginal progesterone prevent recurrent preterm birth in women with a singleton gestation and a history of spontaneous preterm birth? Evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To assess the efficacy and safety of vaginal progesterone to prevent recurrent preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.

DATA SOURCES:
MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL (from their inception to February 28, 2022), Cochrane databases, Google Scholar, bibliographies, and conference proceedings.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
Randomized controlled trials that compared vaginal progesterone to placebo or no treatment in asymptomatic women with a singleton gestation and a history of spontaneous preterm birth.

METHODS:
The primary outcomes were preterm birth <37 and <34 weeks of gestation. The secondary outcomes included adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> test), small-study effects, publication bias, and quality of evidence; performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses; and calculated 95% prediction intervals and adjusted relative risks.

RESULTS:
Ten studies (2958 women) met the inclusion criteria: 7 with a sample size <150 (small studies) and 3 with a sample size >600 (large studies). Among the 7 small studies, 4 were at high risk of bias, 2 were at some concerns of bias, and only 1 was at low risk of bias. All the large studies were at low risk of bias. Vaginal progesterone significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.81; I<sup>2</sup>=75%; 95% prediction interval, 0.31-1.32; very low-quality evidence) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.92; I<sup>2</sup>=66%; 95% prediction interval, 0.23-1.68; very low-quality evidence), and the risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (relative risk, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.85; I<sup>2</sup>=67%; 95% prediction interval, 0.16-1.79; low-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the vaginal progesterone and the placebo or no treatment groups in other adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Subgroup analyses revealed that vaginal progesterone decreased the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.55; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.49; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) in the small but not in the large studies (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.09; I<sup>2</sup>=0% for preterm birth <37 weeks; and relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.13; I<sup>2</sup>=0% for preterm birth <34 weeks). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies at low risk of bias indicated that vaginal progesterone did not reduce the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.09) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.15). There was clear evidence of substantial small-study effects in the meta-analyses of preterm birth <37 and <34 weeks of gestation because of funnel plot asymmetry and the marked differences in the pooled relative risks obtained from fixed-effect and random-effects models. The adjustment for small-study effects resulted in a markedly reduced and nonsignificant effect of vaginal progesterone on preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.10) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.42).

There is no convincing evidence supporting the use of vaginal progesterone to prevent recurrent preterm birth or to improve perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.",To assess the efficacy and safety of vaginal progesterone to prevent recurrent preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.,"The primary outcomes were preterm birth <37 and <34 weeks of gestation.

Among the 7 small studies, 4 were at high risk of bias, 2 were at some concerns of bias, and only 1 was at low risk of bias. All the large studies were at low risk of bias. Vaginal progesterone significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.81; I<sup>2</sup>=75%; 95% prediction interval, 0.31-1.32; very low-quality evidence) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.92; I<sup>2</sup>=66%; 95% prediction interval, 0.23-1.68; very low-quality evidence), and the risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (relative risk, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.85; I<sup>2</sup>=67%; 95% prediction interval, 0.16-1.79; low-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the vaginal progesterone and the placebo or no treatment groups in other adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Subgroup analyses revealed that vaginal progesterone decreased the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.55; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.49; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) in the small but not in the large studies (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.09; I<sup>2</sup>=0% for preterm birth <37 weeks; and relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.13; I<sup>2</sup>=0% for preterm birth <34 weeks). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies at low risk of bias indicated that vaginal progesterone did not reduce the risk of preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.09) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.15). There was clear evidence of substantial small-study effects in the meta-analyses of preterm birth <37 and <34 weeks of gestation because of funnel plot asymmetry and the marked differences in the pooled relative risks obtained from fixed-effect and random-effects models. The adjustment for small-study effects resulted in a markedly reduced and nonsignificant effect of vaginal progesterone on preterm birth <37 weeks (relative risk, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.10) and <34 weeks (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.42).",There is no convincing evidence supporting the use of vaginal progesterone to prevent recurrent preterm birth or to improve perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.,35460628,"['35157571', '30389451', '34800370', '20669423', '26772790', '28065815', '18207020', '22244654', '34171360', '24055578', '31802143', '31872206', '34362802', '31767981', '7978942', '17206962', '19951079', '22177191', '22177186', '25022996', '25124429', '26070700', '8678155', '9609580', '11530116', '16949395', '17190687', '17531896', '18757647', '24036403', '27400000', '34854081', '32068466', '35156708', '28679674', '9207815', '18048376', '20502281', '17531901', '14672496', '34293771', '33773630', '31643080', '19631507', '19631507', '19631507', '30730545', '30730545', '12958120', '27714841', '19381330', '21310794', '27406637', '27406637', '9310563', '16345038', '18538991', '18538991', '10877304', '10877304', '31169736', '17689621', '23479191', '24449319', '24449319', '24449319', '22542023', '22542023', '22542023', '22542023', '22542023', '12592250', '17899572', '19697195', '19697195', '20091317', '20091317', '27326415', '26921136', '28949973', '28949973', '28949973', '11730399', '20639294', '23616031', '23302257', '27140444', '23972520', '24855929', '21727292', '22334559', '27377062', '23403829', '26016488', '11106885', '7823387', '9746022', '17517809', '19950329', '22989478', '27398997', '29126260', '33778858', '33778858', '22695310', '35168930', '35168930', '29157866', '31652479', '17476644', '19138428', '19138428', '32277894', '28223163', '33345927', '34784617', '34972229', '33035472', '29630885', '29941278']","['10.1002/ijgo.14053', '10.1111/ajo.13492', '10.1055/s-0041-1739504', '10.1055/s-0041-1740512']",Does vaginal progesterone prevent recurrent preterm birth in women with a singleton gestation and a history of spontaneous preterm birth?,8/29/2022,Does vaginal progesterone prevent recurrent preterm birth in women with a singleton gestation and a history of spontaneous preterm birth?,There is no convincing evidence supporting the use of vaginal progesterone to prevent recurrent preterm birth or to improve perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
family medicine,pregnancy complications,Is there a maternal blood biomarker that can predict spontaneous preterm birth prior to labour onset? A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
The ability to predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) prior to labour onset is a challenge, and it is currently unclear which biomarker(s), may be potentially predictive of sPTB, and whether their predictive power has any utility. A systematic review was conducted to identify maternal blood biomarkers of sPTB.

METHODS:
This study was conducted according to PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus) were searched up to September 2021 using search terms: ""preterm labor"", ""biomarker"" and ""blood OR serum OR plasma"". Studies assessing blood biomarkers prior to labour onset against the outcome sPTB were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed based on the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Increased odds of sPTB associated with maternal blood biomarkers, as reported by odds ratios (OR), or predictive scores were synthesized. This review was not prospectively registered.

RESULTS:
Seventy-seven primary research articles met the inclusion criteria, reporting 278 unique markers significantly associated with and/or predictive of sPTB in at least one study. The most frequently investigated biomarkers were those measured during maternal serum screen tests for aneuploidy, or inflammatory cytokines, though no single biomarker was clearly predictive of sPTB based on the synthesized evidence. Immune and signaling pathways were enriched within the set of biomarkers and both at the level of protein and gene expression.

CONCLUSION:
There is currently no known predictive biomarker for sPTB. Inflammatory and immune biomarkers show promise, but positive reporting bias limits the utility of results. The biomarkers identified may be more predictive in multi-marker models instead of as single predictors. Omics-style studies provide promising avenues for the identification of novel (and multiple) biomarkers. This will require larger studies with adequate power, with consideration of gestational age and the heterogeneity of sPTB to identify a set of biomarkers predictive of sPTB.","The ability to predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) prior to labour onset is a challenge, and it is currently unclear which biomarker(s), may be potentially predictive of sPTB, and whether their predictive power has any utility.

family medicine,pregnancy complications,Recurrent pregnancy loss: fewer chromosomal abnormalities in products of conception? a meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To compare the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in products of conception (POCs) between recurrent pregnancy loss and sporadic pregnancy loss.

METHODS:
A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases from inception to December 31, 2020. Relevant studies analysing the association between the number of pregnancy losses and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities were included. Independent data extraction was conducted and study quality was assessed. Meta-analyses were carried out to calculate odds ratios by using fixed- or random-effects models according to statistical homogeneity.

RESULTS:
A total of 8320 POCs in 19 studies were identified for the meta-analyses. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in sporadic pregnancy loss was significantly higher than that in recurrent pregnancy loss. In subgroup analyses, the following studies reported a high incidence of abnormal outcomes of sporadic pregnancy loss: studies withââ¥â300 samples, studies published before 2014, studies conducted in European and American countries, and studies with analyses using conventional karyotype techniques. Moreover, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in women with two pregnancy losses was significantly higher than that in women with three or more pregnancy losses. However, there was no difference in the distribution of abnormal types between sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss or between two and three or more pregnancy losses.

CONCLUSIONS:
The prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in POCs was lower in recurrent pregnancy loss than in sporadic pregnancy loss, and decreased with an increasing number of pregnancy losses.",To compare the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities detected in products of conception (POCs) between recurrent pregnancy loss and sporadic pregnancy loss.,"A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases from inception to December 31, 2020.

family medicine,primary care infectious disease,Which aspects of health care are most valued by people living with HIV in high-income countries? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Increasing numbers of people with HIV are living into older age and experiencing comorbidities. The development of new models of care to meet the needs of this population is now a priority. It is important that the views and preferences of patients inform the development of services in order to maintain high levels of patient satisfaction and engagement. The aim of this systematic review was to determine which aspects of healthcare are particularly valued by people living with HIV.

METHODS:
We searched electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles. The search strategy was developed to identify articles reporting on HIV positive patients' perceptions, evaluations or experiences of healthcare services and factors associated with satisfaction with care. Peer-reviewed papers and conference abstracts were included if the study reported on aspects of health care that were valued by people living with HIV, data were collected during the era of combination therapy (from 1996 onwards), and the paper was published in English. A thematic approach to data synthesis was used.

RESULTS:
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies used both qualitative and quantitative methods. Six studies specifically reported on relative importance to patients of different aspects of care. The valued aspects of care identified were grouped into seven themes. These highlighted the importance to patients of: a good health care professional-patient relationship, HIV specialist knowledge, continuity of care, ease of access to services, access to high quality information and support, effective co-ordination between HIV specialists and other healthcare professionals, and involvement in decisions about treatment and care. We were unable to determine the relative importance to patients of different aspects of care because of methodological differences between the studies.

CONCLUSIONS:
This review identified several attributes of healthcare that are valued by people living with HIV, many of which would be relevant to any future reconfiguration of services to meet the needs of an ageing population. Further research is required to determine the relative importance to patients of different aspects of care.",Increasing numbers of people with HIV are living into older age and experiencing comorbidities.

family medicine,primary care infectious disease,Chlamydia prevalence in the general population: is there a sex difference? a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
The focus of Chlamydia trachomatis screening and testing lies more on women than on men. The study aim was to establish by systematic review the prevalence of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and women in the general population.

METHODS:
Electronic databases and reference lists were searched from 2000 to 2013 using the key words ""Chlamydia trachomatis"", ""population-based study"" and ""disease prevalence"". Reference lists were checked. Studies were included in the analysis if Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was reported for both men and women in a population-based study. Prevalence rates for men and women were described as well as highest prevalence rate by age and sex. The difference in prevalence between the sexes in each study was calculated.

RESULTS:
Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment for the review. In nine of the twenty-five studies there was a statistically significant sex difference in the chlamydia prevalence. In all nine studies the prevalence of chlamydia was higher in women than in men. The prevalence for women varied from 1.1% to 10.6% and for men from 0.1% to 12.1%. The average chlamydia prevalence is highly variable between countries. The highest prevalence of chlamydia occurred predominantly in younger age groups (< 25 years). The absence of symptoms in population-based urogenital chlamydia infection is common in men and women (mean 88.5% versus 68.3%).

CONCLUSIONS:
The urogenital chlamydia trachomatis prevalence in the general population is more similar than dissimilar for men and women. A modest sex difference is apparent. The prevalence rates can be used to inform chlamydia screening strategies in general practice.",The focus of Chlamydia trachomatis screening and testing lies more on women than on men.

family medicine,primary care oncology,Are mind-body therapies effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To assess whether mind-body therapies are effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults, since at least one-third of adults with cancer are affected by moderate or severe pain.

METHODS:
We searched for all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that included adults (â¥18 years) with cancer-related pain who were treated with mind-body therapies (mindfulness, hypnosis, yoga, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation) in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science Citation Index, Web of Science, trials registers, and reference lists. The primary outcome was pain intensity. We calculated the standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the risk of bias.

RESULTS:
We identified 40 primary studies involving a total of 3569 participants. The meta-analysis included 24 studies (2404 participants) and showed a significant effect of -0.39 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.16) with considerable heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 86.3%, pÂ <Â 0.001). After we excluded four ""outlier"" studies in sensitivity analyses, the effect size remained significant but weaker. There was a high risk of bias in all studies, for example, performance bias due to lack of participant blinding. Patients in multiple settings were included but many studies were of low quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
Mind-body therapies may be effective in improving cancer pain, but the quality of the evidence is low. There is a need for further high-quality clinical trials.","To assess whether mind-body therapies are effective for relieving cancer-related pain in adults, since at least one-third of adults with cancer are affected by moderate or severe pain.","We searched for all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that included adults (â¥18 years) with cancer-related pain who were treated with mind-body therapies (mindfulness, hypnosis, yoga, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation) in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science Citation Index, Web of Science, trials registers, and reference lists.

family medicine,primary care oncology,Systematic review update of observational studies further supports aspirin role in cancer treatment: Time to share evidence and decision-making with patients?,"BACKGROUND:
Evidence is growing that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with an increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread. We therefore extended up to August 2017 an earlier systematic search and meta-analyses of published studies of low-dose aspirin taken by patients with a diagnosis of cancer.

METHODS:
Searches were completed in Medline and Embase to August 2017 using a pre-defined search strategy to identify reports of relevant studies. References in all the selected papers were scanned. Two reviewers independently applied pre-determined eligibility criteria and extracted data on cause-specific cancer deaths, overall mortality and the occurrence of metastatic spread. Meta-analyses were then conducted for different cancers and heterogeneity and publication bias assessed. Sensitivity analyses and attempts to reduce heterogeneity were conducted.

RESULTS:
Analyses of 29 studies reported since an earlier review up to April 2015 are presented in this report, and these are then pooled with the 42 studies in our earlier publication. Overall meta-analyses of the 71 studies are presented, based on a total of over 120 thousand patients taking aspirin. Ten of the studies also give evidence on the incidence of metastatic cancer spread. There are now twenty-nine observational studies describing colorectal cancer (CRC) and post-diagnostic aspirin. Pooling the estimates of reduction by aspirin which are reported as hazard ratios (HR), gives an overall HR for aspirin and CRC mortality 0.72 (95% CI 0.64-0.80). Fourteen observational studies have reported on aspirin and breast cancer mortality and pooling those that report the association with aspirin as a hazard ratio gives HR 0.69 (0.53-0.90). Sixteen studies report on aspirin and prostate cancer mortality and a pooled estimate yields an HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.73-1.05). Data from 12 reports relating to other cancers are also listed. Ten studies give evidence of a reduction in metastatic spread; four give a pooled HR 0.31 (95% CI 0.18, 0.54) and five studies which reported odds ratio of metastatic spread give OR 0.79 (0.66 to 0.95).

CONCLUSION:
Being almost entirely from observational studies, the evidence of benefit from aspirin is limited. There is heterogeneity between studies and the results are subject to important biases, only some of which can be identified. Nevertheless, the evidence would seem to merit wide discussion regarding whether or not it is adequate to justify the recommendation of low-dose therapeutic aspirin, and if it is, for which cancers?",Evidence is growing that low-dose aspirin used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer is associated with an increased survival and a reduction in metastatic spread.

family medicine,primary care pulmonary disease,Does vitamin D supplementation reduce COVID-19 severity?: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
The evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing severity of COVID-19 is still insufficient. This is partially due to the lack of primary robust trial-based data and heterogeneous study designs.

AIM:
This evidence summary, aims to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on morbidity and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.Design: Evidence summary of systematic reviews.

METHODS:
For this study, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published from December 2019 to January 2022 presenting the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 severity were screened and selected from PubMed and Google scholar. After initial screening, 10 eligible reviews were identified and quality of included reviews were assessed using AMSTAR and GRADE tools and overlapping among the primary studies used were also assessed.

RESULTS:
The number of primary studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 3 to 13. Meta-analysis of seven systematic reviews showed strong evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of mortality (Odds ratio: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.346-0.664; Pâ<â0.001) in COVID patients. It was also observed that supplementation reduces the need for intensive care (Odds ratio: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.28-0.44; Pâ<â0.001) and mechanical ventilation (Odds ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.411-0.708; Pâ<â0.001) requirement. The findings were robust and reliable as level of heterogeneity was considerably low. However the included studies were of varied quality. Qualitative analysis showed that supplements (oral and IV) are well tolerated, safe and effective in COVID patients.

CONCLUSION:
The findings of this study show that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the COVID-19 severity. Hence, vitamin D should be recommended as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19.However, more robust and larger trials are required to substantiate it further.",The evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing severity of COVID-19 is still insufficient.

family medicine,primary care pulmonary disease,The weekend effect: does hospital mortality differ by day of the week? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The concept of a weekend effect, poorer outcomes for patients admitted to hospitals at the weekend is not new, but is the focus of debate in England. Many studies have been published which consider outcomes for patients on admitted at the weekend. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate the effect of weekend admission on mortality in UK hospitals.

METHODS:
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the weekend effect in UK hospitals. We used EMBASE, MEDLINE, HMIC, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus to search for relevant papers. We included systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and observational studies) on patients admitted to hospital in the UK and published after 2001. Our outcome was death; studies reporting mortality were included. Reviewers identified studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. Discrepancy in assessment was considered by a third reviewer. All meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects meta-regression to incorporate the heterogeneity into the weighting.

RESULTS:
Forty five articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. 53% of the articles concluded that outcomes for patients either undergoing surgery or admitted at the weekend were worse. We included 39 in the meta-analysis which contributed 50 separate analyses. We found an overall effect of 1.07 [odds ratio (OR)] (95%CI:1.03-1.12), suggesting that patients admitted at the weekend had higher odds of mortality than those admitted during the week. Sub-group analyses suggest that the weekend effect remained when measures of case mix severity were included in the models (OR:1.06 95%CI:1.02-1.10), but that the weekend effect was not significant when clinical registry data was used (OR:1.03 95%CI: 0.98-1.09). Heterogeneity was high, which may affect generalisability.

CONCLUSIONS:
Despite high levels of heterogeneity, we found evidence of a weekend effect in the UK, even after accounting for severity of disease. Further work is required to examine other potential explanations for the ""weekend effect"" such as staffing levels and other organisational factors.

family medicine,primary care pulmonary disease,Can body mass index predict clinical outcomes for patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The effects of body mass index (BMI) on the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are controversial. We aimed to further determine the relationship between BMI and the acute outcomes of patients with ARDS.

METHODS:
We searched the Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ISI Web of Science for trials published between 1946 and July 2016, using ""BMI"" or ""body mass index"" or ""overweight"" or ""obese"" and ""ARDS"" or ""ALI"" or ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"" or ""acute lung injury"", without limitations on publication type or language. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were conducted, and a random-effects model was applied to calculate the odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD). Review Manager (RevMan) was used to test the hypothesis using the Mann-Whitney U test. The primary outcome was unadjusted mortality, and secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation (MV)-free days and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital.

RESULTS:
Five trials with a total of 6268 patients were pooled in our final analysis. There was statistical heterogeneity between normal-weight and overweight patients in LOS in the ICU (I <sup>2</sup>â=â71%, Ï <sup>2</sup>â=â10.27, Pâ=â0.02) and in MV-free days (I <sup>2</sup>â=â89%, Ï <sup>2</sup>â=â18.45, Pâ<â0.0001). Compared with normal weight, being underweight was associated with higher mortality (OR 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22, 2.08, Pâ=â0.0006), while obesity and morbid obesity were more likely to result in lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57, 0.80, Pâ<â0.00001; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56, 0.93, Pâ=â0.01). MV-free days were much longer in patients with morbid obesity (MD 2.64, 95% CI 0.60, 4.67, Pâ=â0.01), but ICU and hospital LOS were not influenced by BMI. An important limitation of our analysis is the lack of adjustment for age, sex, illness severity, comorbid illness, and interaction of outcome parameters.

family medicine,spinal disease and back pain,Is sequestrectomy a viable alternative to microdiscectomy? A systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Traditionally, lumbar discectomy involves removal of the free disc fragment followed by aggressive or conservative excision of the intervertebral disc. In selected patients, however, it is possible to remove only the free fragment or sequester without clearing the intervertebral disc space. However, there is some controversy about whether that approach is sufficient to prevent recurrent symptoms and to provide adequate pain relief.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:
This systematic review was designed to pose two questions: (1) Does performing a sequestrectomy only without conventional microdiscectomy lead to an increased reherniation rate; and (2) is there a difference in the patient-reported levels of radicular pain?

METHODS:
Systematic MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were carried out to identify all articles published in peer-reviewed journals reporting the outcomes of interest for conventional microdiscectomy versus sequestrectomy for lumbar disc herniation from L2 to the sacrum (Level III evidence and above); hand-searching of bibliographies was also performed. A minimum of Level II evidence was required with a followup rate of greater than 75%. Followup in all studies was from 18 to 86Â months. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The studies were analyzed for operating time, hospital stay, pre- and postoperative visual analog scale, and reherniation rate.

RESULTS:
Patients in both the microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy groups showed comparable improvement of visual analog scale (VAS) score for leg pain. VAS score improvement ranged from 5.6 to 6.5 points in the microdiscectomy groups and 5.5 to 6.6 in the sequestrectomy group. The reherniation rate in the microdiscectomy group ranged from 2.3% to 11.8% and in the sequestrectomy groups from 2% to 12.5%.

CONCLUSIONS:
This review of the available literature suggests that, compared with conventional microdiscectomy, microsurgical lumbar sequestrectomy can achieve comparable reherniation rates and reduction in radicular pain when a small breach in the posterior fibrous ring is found intraoperatively.","Traditionally, lumbar discectomy involves removal of the free disc fragment followed by aggressive or conservative excision of the intervertebral disc.

family medicine,substance use disorders,What factors influence implementation of whole-school interventions aiming to promote student commitment to school to prevent substance use and violence? Systematic review and synthesis of process evaluations.,"BACKGROUND:
Whole-school interventions go beyond classroom health education to modify the school environment to promote health. A sub-set aim to promote student commitment to school to reduce substance use and violence (outcomes associated with low commitment). It is unclear what factors influence implementation of such interventions.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review including synthesis of evidence from process evaluations examining what factors affect implementation. Meta-ethnographic synthesis was informed by May's General Theory of Implementation.

RESULTS:
Sixteen reports, covering 13 studies and 10 interventions were included in our synthesis. In terms of May's concept of 'sense-making', we found that school staff were more likely to understand what was required in implementing an intervention when provided with good-quality materials and support. Staff could sometimes wilfully or unintentionally misinterpret interventions. In terms of May's concept of 'cognitive participation', whereby staff commit to implementation, we found that lack of intervention adaptability could in particular undermine implementation of whole-school elements. Interventions providing local data were reported as helping build staff commitment. School leaders were more likely to commit to an intervention addressing an issue they already intended to tackle. Collaborative planning groups were reported as useful in ensuring staff 'collective action' (May's term for working together) to enact interventions. Collective action was also promoted by the presence of sufficient time, leadership and relationships. Implementation of whole-school interventions took time to build. Considering May's concept of 'reflexive monitoring' (formal or informal review of progress), this was important in assessing and enhancing implementation. 'Quick wins' could help maintain collective impetus to implement further intervention activities.

CONCLUSION:
We identified novel factors influencing implementation of whole-school elements such as: local adaptability of interventions; providing local data to build commitment; interventions addressing an issue already on school leaders' agenda; collaborative planning groups; and 'reflexive monitoring' as an explicit intervention component.",Whole-school interventions go beyond classroom health education to modify the school environment to promote health.

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Is tumor necrosis a clinical prognostic factor in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It has been proven that tumor necrosis is associated with poor prognoses in various solid malignant tumors. However, the prognostic effect of tumor necrosis in hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers is still unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the associations of tumor necrosis with survival outcomes and clinicopathological features in patients with hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers.

METHODS:
Based on the PRISMA statement, eligible studies were identified from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception until January 2023. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to assess the connection between tumor necrosis and hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers. We then choose which effects model to use to generate pooled HRs and 95% CIs, depending on data heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
In total, 6497 articles were identified, 10 of which were included in this meta-analysis. Our results suggested that the presence of tumor necrosis predicted a poorer outcome for overall survival (HRÂ =Â 1.54, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.35-1.77, pÂ <â0.001) and recurrence-free survival (HRÂ =Â 1.69, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.37-2.08, pÂ <â0.001). In addition, tumor necrosis was correlated with larger tumor size, a higher frequency of lymph node metastasis, poorer histologic differentiation, and higher recurrence and metastasis rates.

CONCLUSION:
Our meta-analysis suggests that hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancer patients with tumor necrosis have dismal survival outcomes, and that their tumors have aggressive biological behaviors. Tumor necrosis has the potential to be a promising biomarker for forecasting poor prognosis in these patients.","It has been proven that tumor necrosis is associated with poor prognoses in various solid malignant tumors.

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Does Caudate Resection Improve Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Curative Resection for Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Margin-negative (R0) resection is the strongest positive prognostic factor in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC). Due to its anatomic location, the caudate lobe is frequently involved in PHC. This review aimed to examine the impact of caudate lobe resection (CLR) in addition to hepatectomy and bile duct resection for patients with PHC.

METHODS:
The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were systematically reviewed from inception to October 2021 to identify studies comparing patients undergoing surgical resection with hepatectomy and bile duct resection with or without CLR for treatment of PHC. Outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving R0 resection, overall survival (OS), and perioperative morbidity.

RESULTS:
Altogether, 949 studies were screened. The review included eight observational studies reporting on 1137 patients. The patients who underwent CLR had a higher likelihood of R0 resection (odds ratio [OR], 5.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64-12.95) and a better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) than those who did not. The use of CLR did not increase the risk of perioperative morbidity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.65-1.63).

CONCLUSIONS:
Given the higher likelihood of R0 resection, improved OS, and no apparent increase in perioperative morbidity, this review supports routine caudate lobectomy in the surgical management of PHC. These results should be interpreted with caution given the lack of high-quality prospective data and the high probability of selection bias.","Margin-negative (R0) resection is the strongest positive prognostic factor in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC).

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Local palliative therapies for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction: radiofrequency ablation combined with stent or biliary stent alone? An updated meta-analysis of nineteen trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in radiofrequency ablation combined with stent (RFAâ+âStent) for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RFAâ+âStent compared with biliary stent alone.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception dates to June 20, 2021, for studies that compared RFAâ+âStent and stent alone for unresectable MBO. The main outcomes were survival, patency, and adverse effects. All meta-analyses were calculated using the random-effects model.

RESULTS:
A total of 19 studies involving 1946 patients were included in this study. Compared with stent alone, RFAâ+âStent was significantly associated with better overall survival (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.48, 0.63; Pâ<â0.00001), longer mean survival time (SMD 2.20; 95% CI 1.17, 3.22; Pâ<â0.0001), longer mean stent patency time (SMD 1.37; 95% CI 0.47, 2.26; Pâ=â0.003), higher stent patency at 6Â months (OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.54, 5.18; Pâ=â0.0008). The two interventions had similar incidence of postoperative abdominal pain (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.94, 1.78; Pâ=â0.11), mild bleeding (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.65, 2.54; Pâ=â0.48), cholangitis (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.76, 1.55; Pâ=â0.65), pancreatitis (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.82, 2.38; Pâ=â0.22). Furthermore, the serum bilirubin levels and stricture diameter after operations were significantly alleviated than before operations, but the degree of alleviation between the two groups were not significantly different (all Pâ>â0.05).

CONCLUSION:
Although the alleviation of serum bilirubin and stricture diameter did not differ between the two interventions, RFAâ+âStent can significantly improve the survival and stent patency with comparable procedure-related adverse events than stent alone. Thus, RFAâ+âStent should be recommended as an attractive alternative to biliary stent alone for patients with unresectable MBO.","Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in radiofrequency ablation combined with stent (RFAâ+âStent) for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO).

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Selective or Routine Histology of Cholecystectomy Specimens for Diagnosing Incidental Carcinoma of Gallbladder and Correlation with Careful Intraoperative Macroscopic Examination? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Selective or Routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens for benign gallbladder disease has always been a matter of debate because of the low prevalence and bad prognosis associated with gall bladder carcinoma. The objective of this study is to ascertain whether selective histology can be preferred over Routine histology without any harm.

METHODS:
This systematic review is conducted according to PRISMA's checklist; relevant articles were searched in the database until September 1 2020 in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, manually, with search queries and without date restrictions. Studies included in this systematic review involved patients who underwent cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease and were diagnosed with gallbladder carcinoma incidentally either after selective or routine histology of the gallbladder.

RESULTS:
A total of 24 routine or selective histology recommending studies were selected for the systematic review after following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies comprised 77,213 numbers of patients and 486 numbers of Malignancies. These studies correlate the number of IGBC diagnosed histologically with the number of IGBC's that were suspected by the surgeons intraoperative by macroscopy. Routine recommending studies show a significant number of IGBC diagnosed histologically as missed by surgeons whereas the selective recommending studies show most of the histologically diagnosed IGBC already suspected by the surgeons intraoperative. When comparing the macroscopic details of the IGBC's between routine and selective studies, we found that there was significant overlap. Most of the findings missed by the surgeons as suspicious in routine studies were suspected by the surgeons involved in selective histology recommending studies. Thereby, favouring selective histology and emphasizing the need for careful intraoperative macroscopy for suspecting IGBC.

CONCLUSION:
Selective Histological examination of cholecystectomy specimens can be preferred if a careful intraoperative macroscopic examination is done and patient risk factors are taken into consideration.",Selective or Routine histology of cholecystectomy specimens for benign gallbladder disease has always been a matter of debate because of the low prevalence and bad prognosis associated with gall bladder carcinoma.

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Does high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ of the biliary duct margin affect the prognosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/CIS) of the biliary duct margin was found to not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by recent studies, but it has not yet reached a conclusion.

METHODS:
Eligible studies were searched by PubMed, PMC, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from Jan. 1, 2000 to Jun. 30, 2019, investigating the influences of surgical margin status of biliary duct on the prognosis of patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Overall survival (OS) and local recurrence were evaluated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

RESULTS:
A total of 11 studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis, including 1734 patients in the R0 group, 194 patients in the HGD/CIS group, and 229 patients in the invasive carcinoma (INV) group. The pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.65~1.50), 1.01 (95% CI 0.73~1.41), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.72~1.34), respectively. The pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 1.83 (95% CI 1.09~3.06), 4.52 (95% CI 2.20~9.26), and 3.74 (95% CI 2.34~5.96), respectively. Subgroup analysis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma at early stage showed that the pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 0.54 (95% CI 0.21~1.36), 0.75 (95% CI 0.35~1.58), and 0.74 (95% CI 0.40~1.37), respectively, and the pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rate between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 3.47 (95% CI 1.09~11.02), 9.12 (95% CI 2.98~27.93), and 9.17 (95% CI 2.95~28.55), respectively. However, the pooled OR for the incidence of local recurrence between HGD/CIS group and R0 group was 3.54 (95% CI 1.66~7.53), and the pooled OR for the incidence of local recurrence between HGD/CIS group and INV group was 0.93 (95% CI 0.50~1.74).

CONCLUSION:
With the current data, we concluded that HGD/CIS would increase the risk of local recurrence compared with R0, although it did not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma regardless of TNM stage. However, the conclusion needs to be furtherly confirmed.","High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/CIS) of the biliary duct margin was found to not affect the prognosis of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by recent studies, but it has not yet reached a conclusion.","Eligible studies were searched by PubMed, PMC, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from Jan. 1, 2000 to Jun. 30, 2019, investigating the influences of surgical margin status of biliary duct on the prognosis of patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Is It Time to Consider Laparoscopic Hepatectomy for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma? A Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:
The role of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains indefinite, though the utilization of this minimally invasive approach has been increasing for ICC. We herein performed a meta-analysis to investigate this issue.

METHODS:
Six retrospective studies including 384 patients who had undergone LH and 2147 patients who had undergone open hepatectomy (OH) for ICC were included. The fixed-effects or random-effects models were utilized for data analysis.

RESULTS:
Compared with patients who had undergone OH for ICC, patients who had undergone LH for ICC experienced more R0 resections (81.6 versus 73.8%, risk ratio (RR)â=â1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.14; Pâ=â0.008) but less major hepatectomies (37.7 versus 54.2%, RRâ=â0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79; Pâ<â0.0001), less lymph node dissections (38.0 versus 61.5%, RRâ=â0.62, 95% CI 0.54-0.70; Pâ<â0.0001), and smaller tumor size resected (4.14 versus 4.94Â cm, weighted mean differenceâ=â-â0.80Â cm, 95% CI -â1.38 to -â0.22Â cm; Pâ=â0.007). No significant difference was observed in other perioperative results (all Pâ>â0.05) or overall survival (hazard ratio (HR)â=â1.38, 95% CI 0.63-3.02; Pâ=â0.43).

CONCLUSIONS:
LH has comparable safety, feasibility, and oncological efficacy to that of OH for ICC and has superiority in R0 resection over OH. It may be time to consider LH for ICC only if a more thorough effort on lymph node dissection is undertaken in selective patients at experienced centers.","The role of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains indefinite, though the utilization of this minimally invasive approach has been increasing for ICC.

gastroenterology,biliary tract disease,Use of retrieval bag in the prevention of wound infection in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy: is it evidence-based? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Surgical site infections complicate elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies in 2,4-3,2% of cases. During the operation the gallbladder is commonly extracted with a retrieval bag. We conducted a meta-analysis to clarify whether its use plays a role in preventing infections.

METHODS:
Inclusion criteria: elective cholecystectomy, details about the gallbladder extraction and data about local or systemic infection rate.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
cholecystitis, jaundice, concurrent antibiotic therapy, immunosuppression, cancer. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases was carried out independently by two researchers, according to the PRISMA guidelines and applying the GRADE approach. Terms used were (""gallbladder""AND(""speciment""OR""extraction""OR""extract""))OR(""gallbladder""OR""cholecystectomy"")AND(""bag""OR""retrieval|""OR|""endobag""OR""endocatch"").

RESULTS:
The comprehensive literature revealed 279 articles. The eligible studies were 2 randomized trials and a multicentre prospective study. Wound infections were documented in 14 on 334 (4,2%) patients operated using a retrieval bag versus 16 on 271 (5,9%) patients operated without the use of a retrieval bag. The statistical analysis revealed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.82 (0.41-1.63 95% CI). Concerning sensitivity analysis the estimated pooled RR ranged from 0.72 to 0.96, both not statistically significant. Harbord test did not reveal the occurrence of small-study effect (pâ=â0.892) and the funnel-plot showed no noteworthy pattern.

CONCLUSIONS:
The results of this review highlight the paucity of well-designed large studies and despite limitations related to the low level of evidence, our meta-analysis showed no significant benefit of retrieval bags in reducing the infection rate after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In absence of acute cholecystitis, accidental intraoperative gallbladder perforation or suspected carcinoma their use, to date, may not be mandatory, so that, further studies focusing on complex cases are needed.","Surgical site infections complicate elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies in 2,4-3,2% of cases.

gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Does aerobic exercise reduce NASH and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Exercise is an effective strategy for the prevention and regression of hepatic steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it is unclear whether it can reduce advanced stages of NAFLD, i.e., steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, it is not evident which modality of exercise is optimal to improve/attenuate NAFLD.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim is to systematically review evidence for the effect of aerobic exercise (AE) on NAFLD, in particular non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and Embase. Studies were screened and included according to predefined criteria, data were extracted, and the quality was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias tools by two researchers independently according to the protocol registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021270059). Meta-analyses were performed using a bivariate random-effects model when there were at least three randomized intervention studies (RCTs) with similar intervention modalities and outcome.

RESULTS:
The systematic review process resulted in an inclusion a total of 24 studies, 18 RCTs and six non-RCTs, encompassing 1014 patients with NAFLD diagnosed by histological or radiological findings. Studies were grouped based on the type of AE: moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). A total of twelve meta-analyses were conducted. Compared to controls, MICT resulted in a mean difference (MD) in the NAFLD biomarkers alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of -3.59 (CI: -5.60, -1.59, p<0.001) and -4.05 (CI: -6.39, -1.71, p<0.001), respectively. HIIT resulted in a MD of -4.31 (95% CI: -9.03, 0.41, p=0.07) and 1.02 (95% CI: -6.91, 8.94, p=0.8) for ALT and AST, respectively. Moreover, both AE types compared to controls showed a significantly lower magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) determined liver fat with a MD of -5.19 (95% CI: -7.33, -3.04, p<0.001) and -3.41 (95% CI: -4.74, -2.08, p<0.001), for MICT and HIIT respectively. MICT compared to controls resulted in a significantly higher cardiorespiratory fitness (MD: 4.43, 95% CI: 0.31, 8.55, p=0.03).

CONCLUSION:
Liver fat is decreased by AE with a concomitant decrease of liver enzymes. AE improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of different types of AE on hepatic inflammation andÂ fibrosis.

gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Management of spontaneous portosystemic shunts at the time of liver transplantation: treatment or observation? Results of a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Optimal treatment of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) during liver transplantation (LT) remains debated. We systematically reviewed the literature on definitions, treatment and outcomes of patients presenting SPSS undergoing LT.

METHODS:
According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we used PubMed to retrieve all studies dealing with SPSS and LT between January 1987 and January 2020. The primary endpoints were definitions and outcomes according to the management of SPSS (treatment vs observation).

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies detailing the management of 962 SPSS were retrieved. Hemodynamically significant SPSS were defined as those having diameterââ¥â10Â mm in 41% (nâ=â395) of patients. SPSS were splenorenal (42%), cavo-gastric (15.2%), umbilical (7.4%), mesenterico-caval (nâ=â31; 3.2%), mesenterico-renal (0.1%) and unreported (31.9%), respectively. At the time of LT 372 shunts (38.7%) were treated while 590 were observed (61.3%). During a follow-up time ranging from 4Â months to 5Â years, the reported overall survival (OS) at 1Â year was not significantly different except for one study. Portal vein anastomosis complications (i.e. reduced flow, stenosis or thrombosis) were similarly reported in observed [nâ=â26 (4%)] and ligated SPSS [nâ=â10 (2%)] (pâ=â0.22) but the rate of relaparotomy was significantly higher in observed SPPS (16 vs 2; pâ=â0.01) to rescue post LT portal vein thrombosis (nâ=â6) and reduced portal flow and graft dysfunction (nâ=â10).

gastroenterology,cirrhosis,Does the intermittent Pringle maneuver affect the recurrence following surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:
To evaluate the effect of intermittent pringle maneuver (IPM) on the long-term prognosis and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

METHODS:
Eligible studies were identified by PubMed and other databases from Jan 1st 1990 to Mar 31st 2019. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the effects of IPM on the long-term prognosis and recurrence of patients with HCC.

RESULTS:
Six studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Results showed that there were no differences between IPM group and non-IPM group in the pooled HRs for the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.84~1.28, P = 0.74; HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.81~1.07, P = 0.29; respectively). However, subgroup analysis showed that the pooled Odd ratios (OR) for the 1-year OS and DFS rates of the IPM group when compared with the non-IPM group were 0.65 (95% CI 0.45~0.94, P = 0.02), 0.38 (95% CI 0.20~0.72, P = 0.003), respectively. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportions of liver cirrhosis, HBsAg (+), Child-Pugh A class, multiple tumor, vascular invasion, and major hepatectomy between groups of IPM and non-IPM.

CONCLUSION:
Since IPM would increase the risk of early-recurrence, it should be used cautiously in the procedure of hepatectomy for resectable HCC. However, the current conclusion needs further validation.

gastroenterology,esophageal disease,Which Anastomotic Techniques Is the Best Choice for Cervical Esophagogastric Anastomosis in Esophagectomy? A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:
The optimal choice of anastomotic techniques for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis in esophagectomy remains unclear.

METHODS:
An electronic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (data up to April 2022) was conducted and screened to compare hand sewn (HS), circular stapling (CS), side-to-side linear stapling (LS), and triangulating stapling (TS) for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. Anastomotic leak, pulmonary complications, anastomotic stricture, and reflux esophagitis of the 4 anastomotic techniques were evaluated using a Bayesian network meta-analysis by R.

RESULT:
Twenty-nine studies were ultimately included, with a total of 5,020 patients from 9 randomized controlled trials, 7 prospect cohort studies, and 13 retrospective case-control studies in the meta-analysis. The present study demonstrates that the incidence of anastomotic leakage is lower in TS than HS and CS (TS vs. HS: odds ratio (OR)â=â0.32, 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.9; TS vs. CS: ORâ=â0.37, 95% CI: 0.13 to 1.0), and the incidence of anastomotic stricture is lower in TS than in HS and CS (TS vs. HS: ORâ=â0.32, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.86; TS vs. CS: ORâ=â0.23, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.58). TS ranks best in terms of anastomotic leakage, pulmonary complication, anastomotic stricture, and reflux esophagitis.

gastroenterology,esophageal disease,Is fundoplication necessary after paraesophageal hernia repair? A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION:
Paraesophageal hernias are often asymptomatic, but when symptomatic they should be fixed laparoscopically. A cruroplasty of the diaphragmatic pillars is performed and a fundoplication is usually performed at the time. However, there are times, especially in emergency cases, where it is not always possible to perform a fundoplication. We hypothesized there would be no difference in outcomes whether or not a fundoplication is performed as part of a paraesophageal hernia repair.

METHODS:
A literature review of available clinical databases was performed using PubMed, Clinical Key and Google Scholar. Our search terms were: ""paraesophageal hernia"" ""paraesophageal hernia repair"" ""fundoplication"" ""emergency surgery"" ""no fundoplication"" We excluded studies that were in languages other than English, abstracts and small case series.

Our search criteria yielded a total of 22 studies published between 1997 and 2020. There were a total of 8600 subjects enrolled into this study. The overall pooled prevalence of fundoplication were estimated asÂ 69% (95% CI: 59%-78%). In patients who underwent fundoplication, the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reduced as compared to patients who did not undergo fundoplication (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.40-1.04, pâ=â0.069, I<sup>2</sup>â=â47.2%).

CONCLUSIONS:
There is a higher rate of recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrence of hernia and reoperation when no fundoplication is performed during a paraesophageal hernia repair but a lower risk of dysphagia, but none of these reached statistical significance.(Comment 1) Paraesophageal hernia repair with fundoplication should be performed, but it is acceptable to not do it in certain situations.","Paraesophageal hernias are often asymptomatic, but when symptomatic they should be fixed laparoscopically. A cruroplasty of the diaphragmatic pillars is performed and a fundoplication is usually performed at the time. However, there are times, especially in emergency cases, where it is not always possible to perform a fundoplication. We hypothesized there would be no difference in outcomes whether or not a fundoplication is performed as part of a paraesophageal hernia repair.","A literature review of available clinical databases was performed using PubMed, Clinical Key and Google Scholar.

gastroenterology,esophageal disease,Is peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) more effective than pneumatic dilation and Heller myotomy? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Achalasia is a rare, chronic, and morbid condition with evolving treatment. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has gained considerable popularity, but its comparative effectiveness is uncertain. We aim to evaluate the literature comparing POEM to Heller myotomy (HM) and pneumatic dilation (PD) for the treatment of achalasia.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic review of comparative studies between POEM and HM or PD. A priori outcomes pertained to efficacy, perioperative metrics, and safety. Internal validity of observational studies and randomized trials (RCTs) was judged using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, respectively.

RESULTS:
From 1379 unique literature citations, we included 28 studies comparing POEM and HM (nâ=â21) or PD (nâ=â8), with only 1 RCT addressing each. Aside from two 4-year observational studies, POEM follow-up averagedââ¤â2Â years. While POEM had similar efficacy to HM, POEM treated dysphagia better than PD both in an RCT (treatment ""success"" RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.34-2.17; 126 patients) and in observational studies (Eckardt score MD -Â 0.43, 95% CI -Â 0.71 to -Â 0.16; 5 studies; I<sup>2</sup> 21%; 405 patients). POEM needed reintervention less than PD in an RCT (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.47; 126 patients) and HM in an observational study (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16, 0.68; 98 patients). Though 6-12Â months patient-reported reflux was worse than PD in 3 observational studies (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.02-7.00; I<sup>2</sup> 0%; 164 patients), post-intervention reflux was inconsistently measured and not statistically different in measuresââ¥â1Â year. POEM had similar safety outcomes to both HM and PD, including treatment-related serious adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS:
POEM has similar outcomes to HM and greater efficacy than PD. Reflux remains a critical outcome with unknown long-term clinical significance due to insufficient data and inconsistent reporting.","Achalasia is a rare, chronic, and morbid condition with evolving treatment.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Hypoalbuminemia and colorectal cancer patients: Any correlation?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
In malnourished patients with colorectal cancer, hypoalbuminemia is common and was proposed to determine the postoperative outcome of colorectal surgery. Mounting articles published but have not been evaluated. We aim to assess the predictive value of preoperative hypoalbuminemia in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

METHODS:
We performed a literature search from PubMed, Euro PMC, and Cochrane with the terms serum albumin, hypoalbuminemia, prognosis, outcome, colorectal cancer, and neoplasm. We also hand-searched and included any relevant papers. Hypoalbuminemia is defined as plasma albumin level < 3.5âmg/dL. We restricted the included studies to English language and adults undergoing colectomy, laparotomy, laparoscopy, or abdominoperineal resection. Any types of articles were included, except an abstract-only publication and those that did not report the key exposure or outcome of interest. The key exposures were mortality, hospitalization time, and morbid conditions (thrombosis, surgical site infection, sepsis, and wound events). We pooled the odds ratio from each included literature as effect size. The Newcastle Ottawa scale and GRADE were used to determine the quality of each included study.

RESULTS:
Hereof 7 observational studies (236,480 individuals) were included. Our meta-analysis found that preoperative hypoalbuminemia can predict the postoperative outcome in colorectal cancer patients. Individuals with hypoalbuminemia were not associated with 30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 2.05 [0.72, 5.86], P = .18, I2 = 99%) but were associated with morbidity (RR 2.28 [1.78, 2.93], P < .00001, I2 = 87.5%), surgical complication (RR 1.69 [1.34, 2.13], P < .00001, I2 = 98%), and hospitalization (RR 2.21 [1.93, 2.52], P < .00001, I2 = 0%). According to newcastle ottawa scale, the included studies are of moderate to sound quality.

CONCLUSIONS:
The current systematic review and meta-analysis showed that preoperative hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with morbidity, length of stay, and surgical complication but not mortality.","In malnourished patients with colorectal cancer, hypoalbuminemia is common and was proposed to determine the postoperative outcome of colorectal surgery.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Should we screen for colorectal cancer in people aged 75 and over? A systematic review - collaborative work of the French geriatric oncology society (SOFOG) and the French federation of digestive oncology (FFCD).,"BACKGROUND:
We have done a systematic literature review about CRC Screening over 75Â years old in order to update knowledge and make recommendations.

METHODS:
PUBMED database was searched in October 2021 for articles published on CRC screening in the elderly, and generated 249 articles. Further searches were made to find articles on the acceptability, efficacy, and harms of screening in this population, together with the state of international guidelines.

RESULTS:
Most benefit-risk data on CRC screening in the over 75Â s derived from simulation studies. Most guidelines recommend stopping cancer screening at the age of 75. In private health systems, extension of screening up to 80-85Â years is, based on the life expectancy and the history of screening. Screening remains effective in populations without comorbidity given their better life-expectancy. Serious adverse events of colonoscopy increase with age and can outweigh the benefit of screening. The great majority of reviews concluded that screening between 75 and 85Â years must be decided case by case.

CONCLUSION:
The current literature does not allow Evidence-Based Medicine propositions for mass screening above 75Â years old. As some subjects over 75Â years may benefit from CRC screening, we discussed ways to introduce CRC screening in France in the 75-80 age group.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,When Is a Diverting Stoma Indicated after Low Anterior Resection? A Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials and Meta-Regression of the Risk Factors of Leakage and Complications in Non-Diverted Patients.,"BACKGROUND:
Anastomotic leak (AL) is a potentially life-threatening complication after low anterior resection (LAR). This meta-analysis aimed to compare outcomes of LAR with and without diverting stoma and to determine factors associated with AL in non-diverted patients.

METHODS:
This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). Randomized controlled trials comparing LAR with and without diverting stoma were included. Main outcome measures were AL, complications, and operation time in the two groups and risk factors of AL in non-diverted patients.

RESULTS:
Nine randomized control trials (RCTs) (946 patients; 53.2% male) were included. The diverting stoma group had lower odds of complications (OR: 0.61, 95%CI: 0.461-0.828; pâ<â0.001), AL (OR: 0.362, 95%CI: 0.236-0.555; pâ<â0.001, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0), abscess (OR: 0.392, 95%CI: 0.174-0.883; pâ<â0.024, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0), and reoperation (OR: 0.352, 95%CI: 0.222-0.559, pâ<â0.001, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0) than the no-diversion group. Both groups had comparable odds of bowel obstruction, surgical site infection, and perioperative mortality.

Factors significantly associated with AL in non-diverted patients were higher body mass index (BMI), ASAââ¥â3, lower tumor height, neoadjuvant therapy, open surgery, end-to-end anastomosis, and longer operation time.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Is a Distal Resection Margin ofââ¤â1Â cm Safe in Patients with Intermediate- to Low-Lying Rectal Cancer? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It is generally accepted that the distal resection margin of intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer should be greater than 2Â cm and at least 1Â cm in special cases. This study intends to investigate whether a distal resection marginââ¤â1Â cm affects tumor outcomes for patients with intermediate- to low-lying rectal cancer.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Sixteen studies included data for distal resection marginsââ¤â1Â cm (1684 cases) andâ>â1Â cm (5877 cases), and 5 studies included survival data. Meta-analysis was used to compare the local recurrence rate and long-term survival of patients with distal resection marginsâ>âorââ¤â1Â cm.

RESULTS:
The local recurrence rate in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (9.5%) was 2.3% higher than that in theâ>â1-cm margin group (7.2%) according to a fixed-effects model (RR [95% CI] 1.42 [1.18, 1.70], Pâ<â0.001). The overall survival results of the five 1-cm margin studies showed an HR (95% CI) of 0.96 (0.75, 1.24) (Pâ=â0.78). Subgroup analysis showed that the local recurrence rate in the subgroup with perioperative treatment was 1.2% lower in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (8.3%) than in theâ>â1-cm margin group (9.5%) (RR [95% CI] 0.97 [0.63, 1.49], Pâ=â0.90). In the surgery alone subgroup, the local recurrence rate was 4.7% higher in theââ¤â1-cm margin group (12.4%) than in theâ>â1-cm group (7.7%) (RR [95% CI] 1.76 [1.09, 2.83], Pâ=â0.02).

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal cancer,Is inguinal hernia associated with an increased risk of colon cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The presence of an inguinal hernia has been associated with an increased risk of identifying colon cancer, and therefore colonoscopy is recommended prior to inguinal hernia repair. However, the evidence on the association between the presence of an inguinal hernia and colon cancer is conflicting and uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize all available evidence on this topic.

METHODS:
A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed. Any comparative study (case-control or cohort study) comparing the rate of colon cancer detection in patients with and without inguinal hernias who underwent screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted and pooled under a random effects model.

RESULTS:
The initial search identified 692 references, of which 4 comparative studies (1462 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low. Pooled results showed a statistically non-significant difference in the incidence of detection of colon cancer, with patients with inguinal hernia having a 1.26 times increased likelihood of colon cancer diagnosis compared with patients without inguinal hernia (odds ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-2.51; Pâ=â0.51). Although patients with inguinal hernia were also 1.23 times more likely to be diagnosed with colon polyps compared to patients without inguinal hernia, this difference was statistically non-significant (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.94-1.60; Pâ=â0.12).

CONCLUSION:
The findings from this first systematic review and meta-analysis show that there is no difference in the incidence of either colon cancer or colon polyps in patients presenting with inguinal hernias compared to those without. Nevertheless, larger prospective studies are needed to further investigate the relationship between the risk of colon cancer or polyps and the presence of inguinal hernia.","The presence of an inguinal hernia has been associated with an increased risk of identifying colon cancer, and therefore colonoscopy is recommended prior to inguinal hernia repair. However, the evidence on the association between the presence of an inguinal hernia and colon cancer is conflicting and uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize all available evidence on this topic.",A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed. Any comparative study (case-control or cohort study) comparing the rate of colon cancer detection in patients with and without inguinal hernias who underwent screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted and pooled under a random effects model.,"The initial search identified 692 references, of which 4 comparative studies (1462 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was low. Pooled results showed a statistically non-significant difference in the incidence of detection of colon cancer, with patients with inguinal hernia having a 1.26 times increased likelihood of colon cancer diagnosis compared with patients without inguinal hernia (odds ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-2.51; Pâ=â0.51). Although patients with inguinal hernia were also 1.23 times more likely to be diagnosed with colon polyps compared to patients without inguinal hernia, this difference was statistically non-significant (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.94-1.60; Pâ=â0.12).","The findings from this first systematic review and meta-analysis show that there is no difference in the incidence of either colon cancer or colon polyps in patients presenting with inguinal hernias compared to those without.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal disease,<i>Helicobacter</i><i>pylori</i> Infection-A Risk Factor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome? An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"UNLABELLED:
Nowadays, the relationship between <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection (HPI) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains controversial.

OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.

METHODS:
We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the association between HPI and IBS. Subgroup analyses were conducted for further assessment and exploration of heterogeneity sources. In addition, we assessed publication bias through funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results.

RESULTS:
Thirteen studies with 13,173 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between HPI and IBS was 1.03 (95% CI [0.80,1.31]; <i>p</i> = 0.84). The adjusted OR of the association between HPI and IBS after excluding the studies with confounding factors defined by our team was 1.29 (95% CI [1.03,1.62]; <i>p</i> = 0.03). We found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D (diarrhea subtype) (OR: 1.54; 95% CI [1.22,1.95]; <i>p</i> = 0.0003). The OR of the relationship between cytotoxin-associated gene A (Cag A) positive HPI and IBS was 4.3 (95% CI [0.51,36.17]; <i>p</i> = 0.18).

CONCLUSIONS:
The likelihood of HPI in IBS patients is relatively higher than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant, implying that HPI is not significantly associated with IBS, albeit we may underestimate this association. Moreover, we found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D. We also observed an increased likelihood of Cag-A positive HPI in IBS patients than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant.",The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.,"We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,A systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic-assisted transabdominal total mesorectal excision and transanal total mesorectal excision: which approach offers optimal short-term outcomes for mid-to-low rectal adenocarcinoma?,"BACKGROUND:
Resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma can be challenging in the narrow pelvis of male patients. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) appears to offer technical advantages for distal rectal tumours, and robotic-assisted transabdominal TME (rTME) was introduced in effort to improve operative precision and ergonomics. However, no study has comprehensively compared these approaches. The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to compare postoperative short-term outcomes in rTME and TaTME.

METHODS:
A systematic online search (1974-July 2020) of MEDLINE, Embase, web of science and google scholar was conducted for trials, prospective or retrospective studies involving rTME, or TaTME for rectal cancer. Outcome variables included: hospital stay; operation duration, blood loss; resection margins; proportion of histologically complete resected specimens; lymph nodes; overall complications; anastomotic leak, and 30-day mortality.

RESULTS:
Sixty-two articles met the inclusion criteria, including 37 studies (3835 patients) assessing rTME resection, 23 studies (1326 patients) involving TaTME and 2 comparing both (165 patients). Operating time was longer in rTME (309.2Â min, 95% CI 285.5-332.8) than in TaTME studies (256.2Â min, 95% CI 231.5-280.9) (pâ=â0.002). rTME resected specimens had a larger distal resection margin (2.62Â cm, 95% CI 2.35-2.88) than in TaTME studies (2.10Â cm, 95% CI 1.83-2.36) (pâ=â0.007). Other outcome variables did not significantly differ between the two techniques.

CONCLUSIONS:
rTME provides similar pathological and short-term outcomes to TaTME and both are reasonable surgical approaches for patients with mid-to-low rectal cancer. To definitively answer the question of the optimal TME technique, we suggest a prospective trial comparing both techniques assessing long-term survival as a primary outcome.","Resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma can be challenging in the narrow pelvis of male patients.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Can adjuncts to bowel preparation for colonoscopy improve patient experience and result in superior bowel cleanliness? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Bowel preparation for colonoscopy is often poorly tolerated due to poor palatability and adverse effects. This can negatively impact on the patient experience and on the quality of bowel preparation. This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess whether adjuncts to bowel preparation affected palatability, tolerability and quality of bowel preparation (bowel cleanliness).

METHODS:
A systematic search strategy was conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify studies evaluating adjunct use for colonoscopic bowel preparation. Studies comparing different regimens and volumes were excluded. Specific outcomes studied included palatability (taste), willingness to repeat bowel preparation, gastrointestinal adverse events and the quality of bowel preparation. Data across studies were pooled using a random-effects model and heterogeneity assessed using <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>-statistics.

RESULTS:
Of 467 studies screened, six were included for analysis (all single-blind randomised trials; <i>n</i>â=â1187 patients). Adjuncts comprised citrus reticulata peel, orange juice, menthol candy drops, simethicone, Coke Zero and sugar-free chewing gum. Overall, adjunct use was associated with improved palatability (mean difference 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.96, <i>p</i>â<â0.001) on a scale of 0-5, acceptability of taste (odds ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.52-4.95, <i>p</i>â<â0.001) and willingness to repeat bowel preparation (odds ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval: 1.97-4.35, <i>p</i>â<â0.001). Patients in the adjunct group reported lower rates of bloating (odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.29-0.77, <i>p</i>â=â0.003) and vomiting (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.81, <i>p</i>â=â0.007), but no difference in nausea (<i>p</i>â=â0.10) or abdominal pain (<i>p</i>â=â0.62). Adjunct use resulted in superior bowel cleanliness (odds ratio 2.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.31-4.85, <i>p</i>â=â0.006). Heterogeneity varied across outcomes, ranging from 0% (vomiting) to 81% (palatability), without evidence of publication bias. The overall quality of evidence was rated moderate.

CONCLUSION:
In this meta-analysis, the use of adjuncts was associated with better palatability, less vomiting and bloating, willingness to repeat bowel preparation and superior quality of bowel preparation. The addition of adjuncts to bowel preparation may improve outcomes of colonoscopy and the overall patient experience.","Bowel preparation for colonoscopy is often poorly tolerated due to poor palatability and adverse effects.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Should the rectal defect be closed following transanal local excision of rectal tumors? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Transanal local excision (TLE) has become the treatment of choice for benign and early-stage selected malignant tumors. However, closure of the rectal wall defect remains a controversial point and the available literature still remains unclear. Our aim was to determine through a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of relevant studies whether or not the wall defect following TLE of rectal tumors should be closed.

METHODS:
Medline and the Cochrane Trials Register were searched for trials published up to December 2016 comparing open versus closed management of the surgical rectal defect after TLE of rectal tumors. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0.

RESULTS:
Four studies were analyzed, yielding 489 patients (317 in the closed group and 182 in the open group). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the closed and open groups regarding the overall morbidity rate (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.32-4.91; pÂ =Â 0.74), postoperative local infection rate (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.23-1.62; pÂ =Â 0.33), postoperative bleeding rate (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.29-1.77; pÂ =Â 0.63), and postoperative reintervention rate (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.52-9.47; pÂ =Â 0.29).

CONCLUSIONS:
This review and meta-analysis suggest that there is no difference between closure or non-closure of wall defects after TLE.","Transanal local excision (TLE) has become the treatment of choice for benign and early-stage selected malignant tumors.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Is POEM the Answer for Management of Spastic Esophageal Disorders? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:
Spastic esophageal disorders (SEDs) include spastic achalasia (type III), diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), and nutcracker/jackhammer esophagus (JH). Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of achalasia. Recently, POEM has been indicated for the treatment of SEDs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the clinical success and safety of POEM in SEDs.

METHODS:
We searched several databases from 01/01/2007 to 01/10/2016 to identify studies (with five or more patients) on POEM for the treatment of SEDs. Weighted pooled rates (WPRs) for clinical success and adverse events (AEs) were calculated for all SEDs. Clinical success was defined as Eckardt scores of â¤3 and/or improvement in severity of dysphagia based on achalasia disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire. The WPRs for clinical success and AEs were analyzed using fixed- or random-effects model based on heterogeneity. The proportionate difference in clinical success and post-procedure adverse event rates among individual types of SEDs was also calculated.

RESULTS:
A total of eight observational studies with 179 patients were included in the final analysis. Two studies were of good quality and six were of fair quality based on the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool. The WPR with 95% confidence interval (CI) for cumulative clinical success of POEM in all SEDs was 87% (78, 93%), I <sup>2</sup>Â =Â 37%. The total number of patients for individual disorders, i.e., type III achalasia, JH, and DES, was 116, 37, and 18, respectively. The WPRs for clinical success of POEM for type III achalasia, DES, and JH were 92, 88, and 72%, respectively. Proportion difference of WPR for clinical success was significantly higher for type III achalasia in comparison with JH (20%, PÂ =Â 0.01). The WPR with 95% CI for AEs of POEM in all SEDs was 14% (9, 20%), I <sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0%. The WPRs for post-procedure adverse events for type III achalasia, DES, and JH were 11, 14, and 16%, respectively. There was no difference in safety of POEM among individual SEDs.

CONCLUSION:
POEM is an effective and safe therapeutic modality for the treatment of spastic esophageal disorders.","Spastic esophageal disorders (SEDs) include spastic achalasia (type III), diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), and nutcracker/jackhammer esophagus (JH).

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,How Efficacious Are Patient Education Interventions to Improve Bowel Preparation for Colonoscopy? A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:
Bowel preparation is inadequate in a large proportion of colonoscopies, leading to multiple clinical and economic harms. While most patients receive some form of education before colonoscopy, there is no consensus on the best approach.

AIMS:
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of patient education interventions to improve bowel preparation.

METHODS:
We searched the Cochrane Database, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a patient education intervention; (2) a primary aim of improving bowel preparation; (3) a validated bowel preparation scale; (4) a prospective design; (5) a concurrent control group; and, (6) adult participants. Study validity was assessed using a modified Downs and Black scale.

RESULTS:
1,080 abstracts were screened. Seven full text studies met inclusion criteria, including 2,660 patients. These studies evaluated multiple delivery platforms, including paper-based interventions (three studies), videos (two studies), re-education telephone calls the day before colonoscopy (one study), and in-person education by physicians (one study). Bowel preparation significantly improved with the intervention in all but one study. All but one study were done in a single center. Validity scores ranged from 13 to 24 (maximum 27). Four of five abstracts and research letters that met inclusion criteria also showed improvements in bowel preparation. Statistical and clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.

CONCLUSION:
Compared to usual care, patient education interventions appear efficacious in improving the quality of bowel preparation. However, because of the small scale of the studies and individualized nature of the interventions, results of these studies may not be generalizable to other settings. Healthcare practices should consider systematically evaluating their current bowel preparation education methods before undertaking new interventions.","Bowel preparation is inadequate in a large proportion of colonoscopies, leading to multiple clinical and economic harms.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal endoscopy,Does lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy pose a risk for mother and child? - a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Gastrointestinal endoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal disorders. When endoscopy is indicated during pregnancy, concerns about the effects on pregnancy outcome often arise. The aim of this study was to assess whether lower gastrointestinal endoscopies (LGEs) across all three trimesters of pregnancy affects pregnancy outcomes.

METHODS:
A systematic literature search was performed using Embase (including MEDLINE), Medline OvidSP, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web-of-Science, Google scholar and Pubmed. All original research articles from 1990 until May 2014 involving pregnant women who underwent LGE for any indication were included. Adverse pregnancy events like spontaneous abortion, preterm birth and fetal demise were assessed for a temporal and etiological relation with the LGE.

RESULTS:
In total, 5514 references were screened by two independent reviewers. Eighty-two references met the inclusion criteria and were selected. Two retrospective, controlled studies, one uncontrolled study and 79 case reports were identified. In the three studies, birth outcomes did not differ between women undergoing LGE during pregnancy, compared to women that had an indication for LGE but in whom LGE was not performed because of pregnancy. In 79 case reports, 92 patients are described who underwent 100 LGE's during pregnancy. LGEs performed in all trimesters (n = 32, 39 and 29) were both temporally and etiologically related to 1, 3 and 2 adverse events, respectively.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the available literature, this review concludes that lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy is of low risk for mother and child in all three trimesters of pregnancy.","Gastrointestinal endoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal disorders.

LGEs performed in all trimesters (n = 32, 39 and 29) were both temporally and etiologically related to 1, 3 and 2 adverse events, respectively.","Based on the available literature, this review concludes that lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy is of low risk for mother and child in all three trimesters of pregnancy.",25849032,"['18838718', '23290773', '20506671', '12635415', '1858760', '8237939', '8607505', '9011442', '22579258', '7851214', '16133002', '16249983', '15306605', '17009112', '17566033', '21575893', '2258077', '22666268', '10546731', '7782453', '14714262', '15065011', '16940730', '19137604', '26190243', '23676589', '23404436', '18357450', '21803658', '22546424', '24371662', '12780621', '14606025', '16052398', '17521645', '1350194', '8404926', '8198108', '10639707', '11692068', '24447671', '16062167', '25150133', '8260353', '22649341', '8798305', '10659920', '21741751', '24355771', '8662424', '7639239', '11684827', '19662588', '22610742', '1699415', '9062163', '18753184', '23389374', '22821142', '23196388', '10484025', '22270292', '21975385', '11726078', '2166491', '10869797', '11209639', '17009643', '17441896', '9559642', '2181117', '15991065', '22277807', '17377607', '18437404', '19745034', '1590863', '10483546', '12128267', '19036694', '8491335', '9572371', '20055563', '21114581', '8651188', '11051378', '21563058', '21552436', '16320006']","['10.7326/0003-4819-149-9-200811040-00245', '10.1016/j.gie.2012.11.012', '10.1016/S0889-8553(02)00137-1', '10.1007/BF02100127', '10.1016/j.gie.2012.02.029', '10.1007/BF02065437', '10.1007/s00384-005-0027-z', '10.1136/gut.2003.036103', '10.1007/s10620-006-9452-2', '10.1136/gut.2006.105288', '10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.004', '10.1016/0090-8258(90)90259-N', '10.1097/00006250-199911000-00029', '10.1007/s00535-003-1232-6', '10.1007/s00535-003-1295-4', '10.1159/000095478', '10.1002/ibd.20858', '10.1007/s12328-010-0158-9', '10.2169/internalmedicine.52.9466', '10.1007/s00404-013-2748-5', '10.1007/s00280-008-0731-9', '10.1016/j.clcc.2011.06.003', '10.1016/j.jmig.2011.12.018', '10.1016/j.gynor.2012.11.003', '10.1046/j.1463-1318.2002.00296.x', '10.1055/s-2003-43477', '10.1055/s-2005-872433', '10.1016/j.gie.2006.11.021', '10.1111/j.1479-828X.1992.tb01896.x', '10.1007/BF01970971', '10.1007/BF02482218', '10.1097/00042737-200111000-00020', '10.1016/j.jnci.2014.03.003', '10.1159/000338809', '10.1111/j.1479-828X.1996.tb03276.x', '10.1016/S0301-2115(99)00093-7', '10.1016/j.ejogrb.2011.05.024', '10.1016/j.ajem.2013.11.024', '10.1007/BF00193051', '10.1159/000048851', '10.1055/s-0028-1109423', '10.1016/0002-9378(90)90682-W', '10.1006/gyno.1996.4549', '10.1177/1078155208094101', '10.1007/s00384-012-1540-5', '10.1007/s12029-012-9463-5', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01394.x', '10.1097/AOG.0b013e318242e386', '10.1097/RLU.0b013e3182291a2d', '10.1001/archinte.1990.00040031749028', '10.1016/S0301-2115(99)00276-6', '10.1111/j.1447-0756.2007.00510.x', '10.1007/BF02235775', '10.1136/jramc-136-01-10', '10.1007/s10350-005-0118-5', '10.1016/j.dld.2011.12.004', '10.1038/sj.jp.7211669', '10.1007/s00404-008-0656-x', '10.1099/jmm.0.012526-0', '10.1055/s-2007-994680', '10.1016/S0301-2115(02)00052-0', '10.3816/CCC.2008.n.054', '10.1016/0028-2243(93)90257-D', '10.1055/s-2007-993919', '10.3109/15513810903266625', '10.1111/j.1447-0756.2010.01379.x', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.2000.03212.x', '10.1055/s-0030-1256233', '10.1159/000326938', '10.1007/s10350-005-0210-x']",Does lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy pose a risk for mother and child?,2/29/2016,Does lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy pose a risk for mother and child?,Based on the available literature lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy is of low risk for mother and child in all three trimesters of pregnancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Are gastrointestinal symptoms associated with higher risk of Mortality in COVID-19 patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Several clinical investigations suggested that gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with disease severity of COVID-19. However, the relevance of gastrointestinal symptoms and mortality of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aim to investigate the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19 mortality.

METHODS:
We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane for studies published between Dec 1, 2019 and May 1, 2021, that had data on gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Additional literatures were obtained by screening the citations of included studies and recent reviews. Only studies that reported the mortality of COVID-19 patients with/without gastrointestinal symptoms were included. Raw data were pooled to calculate OR (Odds Ratio). The mortality was compared between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as between patients with and without individual symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain).

RESULTS:
Fifty-three literatures with 55,245 COVID-19 patients (4955 non-survivors and 50,290 survivors) were included. The presence of GI symptoms was not associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients (OR=0.88; 95% CI 0.71-1.09; P=0.23). As for individual symptoms, diarrhea (OR=1.01; 95% CI 0.72-1.41; P=0.96), nausea/vomiting (OR=1.16; 95% CI 0.78-1.71; P=0.46) and abdominal pain (OR=1.55; 95% CI 0.68-3.54; P=0.3) also showed non-relevance with the death of COVID-19 patients.

CONCLUSIONS:
Gastrointestinal symptoms are not associated with higher mortality of COVID-19 patients. The prognostic value of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 requires further investigation.","Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in patients with COVID-19.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Is there an association between <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and irritable bowel syndrome? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and debilitating gastrointestinal condition. Research has reported persistent, low-grade mucosal inflammation and significant overlaps between patients with IBS and those with dyspepsia, suggesting a possible pathogenic role of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) in IBS. This study therefore aimed to provide the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and IBS.

AIM:
To investigate the association between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and IBS.

METHODS:
Using the keywords ""<i>H. pylori</i> OR Helicobacter OR Helicobacter pylori OR infection"" AND ""irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS"", a preliminary search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar and WanFang databases yielded 2924 papers published in English between 1 January 1960 and 1 June 2018. Attempts were also made to search grey literature.

RESULTS:
A total of 13 clinical studies were systematically reviewed and nine studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis found a slight increased likelihood of <i>H. pylori</i> infection in patients with IBS, albeit this was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.90-2.40, <i>P</i> = 0.123). It must also be acknowledged that all of the available studies reported only crude odd ratios. <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy also does not appear to improve IBS symptoms. Although publication bias was not observed in the funnel plot, there was a high degree of heterogeneity amongst the studies included in the meta-analysis (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 87.38%).

CONCLUSION:
Overall, current evidence does not support an association between IBS and <i>H. pylori</i> infection. Further rigorous and detailed studies with larger sample sizes and after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy are warranted.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and debilitating gastrointestinal condition.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Is it safe to go back into the water? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of acquiring infections from recreational exposure to seawater.,"BACKGROUND:
Numerous illnesses are associated with bathing in natural waters, although it is assumed that the risk of illness among bathers exposed to relatively clean waters found in high-income countries is negligible. A systematic review was carried out to quantify the increased risk of experiencing a range of adverse health outcomes among bathers exposed to coastal water compared with non-bathers.

METHODS:
In all 6919 potentially relevant titles and abstracts were screened, and from these 40 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Odds ratios (OR) were extracted from 19 of these reports and combined in random-effect meta-analyses for the following adverse health outcomes: incident cases of any illness, ear infections, gastrointestinal illness and infections caused by specific microorganisms.

RESULTS:
There is an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of any illness [OR = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 2.64, P = 0.001] and ear ailments (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.82, P < 0.001) in bathers compared with non-bathers. There is also an increased risk of experiencing gastrointestinal ailments (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.49, P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:
This is the first systematic review to evaluate evidence on the increased risk of acquiring illnesses from bathing in seawater compared with non-bathers. Our results support the notion that infections are acquired from bathing in coastal waters, and that bathers have a greater risk of experiencing a variety of illnesses compared with non-bathers.","Numerous illnesses are associated with bathing in natural waters, although it is assumed that the risk of illness among bathers exposed to relatively clean waters found in high-income countries is negligible.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Postoperative changes of the microbiome: are surgical complications related to the gut flora? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
The purpose of this review was to identify the relationship between the gut microbiome and the development of postoperative complications like anastomotic leakage or a wound infection. Recent reviews focusing on underlying molecular biology suggested that postoperative complications might be influenced by the patients' gut flora. Therefore, a review focusing on the available clinical data is needed.

METHODS:
In January 2017 a systematic search was carried out in Medline and WebOfScience to identify all clinical studies, which investigated postoperative complications after gastrointestinal surgery in relation to the microbiome of the gut.

RESULTS:
Of 337 results 10 studies were included into this analysis after checking for eligibility. In total, the studies comprised 677 patients. All studies reported a postoperative change of the gut flora. In five studies the amount of bacteria decreased to different degrees after surgery, but only one study found a significant reduction. Surgical procedures tended to result in an increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. The rate of infectious complications was lower in patients treated with probiotics/symbiotics compared to control groups without a clear relation to the systemic inflammatory response. The treatment with synbiotics/probiotics in addition resulted in faster recovery of bowel movement and a lower rate of postoperative diarrhea and abdominal cramping.

CONCLUSIONS:
There might be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications. Due to methodological shortcomings of the included studies and uncontrolled bias/confounding factors there remains a high level of uncertainty.","The purpose of this review was to identify the relationship between the gut microbiome and the development of postoperative complications like anastomotic leakage or a wound infection.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,Confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes: new ideal method for differentiation of ITB and CD? A meta analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
There are few widely accepted criteria other than caseation, which has low sensitivity, for differentiating intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD).

OBJECTIVE:
We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the use of confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes as histological methods for differentiating ITB and CD, compared with that of caseation.

METHODS:
We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Database for all relevant studies on the histological differentiation of ITB and CD. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated for each study. Study quality and heterogeneity were assessed. Meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed.

RESULTS:
Ten randomized trials involving 316 ITB and 376 CD patients were included. The results showed that analysis of caseation showed an overall weighted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9966, overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.21 and 1.00, respectively, with a positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of 10.79, negative likelihood ratio(-LR) of 0.82 and DOR of 13.74. Confluent granulomas had a lower overall weighted AUC of 0.9381, sensitivity and specificity were 0.38 and 0.99, respectively, with a +LR of 16.29, -LR of 0.65 and DOR of 26.52. Overall weighted AUC for ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes was 0.9017, sensitivity and specificity were 0.41 and 0.94, respectively, with a +LR of 6.46, -LR of 0.54 and DOR of 13.17. Significant heterogeneity was noted for the studies. Meta-regression analysis showed that study source, publication year, size, design and quality did not affect heterogeneity.

CONCLUSION:
Confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes are helpful in distinguishing ITB from CD, which may provide a new method, other than caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli, to differentiate ITB and CD in mucosal biopsies.","We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the use of confluent granulomas and ulcers lined by epithelioid histiocytes as histological methods for differentiating ITB and CD, compared with that of caseation.","We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Database for all relevant studies on the histological differentiation of ITB and CD.

gastroenterology,gastrointestinal infections,How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces.

METHODS:
The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included.

RESULTS:
Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days.

CONCLUSION:
The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.",Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Does adjuvant hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy improve patient outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma following liver resection? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Adjuvant hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been shown to be beneficial to the patient outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

METHODS:
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were identified from six databases up to January 26, 2023. Patient outcomes were assessed using overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Data were presented as hazard ratios (HR, 95% confidence intervals, or CIs).

RESULTS:
The present systematic review included 2 RCTs and 9 non-RCTs with a total of 1290 cases. Adjuvant HAIC improved OS (HR of 0.69; 95% CI of 0.56-0.84; pâ<â0.01) and DFS (HR of 0.64; 95% CI of 0.49-0.83; pâ<â0.01).

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Can living donor liver transplantation provide similar outcomes to deceased-donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:
A potential solution to the deceased organ shortage is to include live organ donations and to identify patients with lower rates of HCC recurrence to fairly allocate liver grafts. Our aims were to detect the long-term outcomes of LDLT versus DDLT for HCC and predictors of recurrence after transplantation.

METHODS:
PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library were searched for eligible studies from inception to July 2021 and a systematic review and meta-analysis were done.

RESULTS:
35 studies with a total of 7822 patients were included. The 1-, 3-, 4Â year-OS showed trivial improvement for LDLT recipients. However, the two modalities had similar 5-, 6- and 10-year OS. A significant improvement in the ITT-OS was observed for LDLT recipients. Regarding the DFS and recurrence after transplantation, no significant difference was observed between LDLT and DDLT. In addition to that, the pooled hazard ratio of the included studies showed that Milan criteria, level of AFP, presence of vascular invasion, tumor differentiation were significant predictors of recurrence.

CONCLUSION:
The cancer biology (not the graft type) is the most important determinant of recurrence and survival after LT. However, LDLT provided much better survival benefits to HCC patients especially in regions that suffer from low deceased organ availability.",A potential solution to the deceased organ shortage is to include live organ donations and to identify patients with lower rates of HCC recurrence to fairly allocate liver grafts.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,"Can ""no-touch"" radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma improve local tumor control? Systematic review and meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES:
Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but local tumor progression (LTP) has been a main limitation of RFA. This study aims to evaluate the LTP of percutaneous no-touch RFA (NtRFA) for HCC â¤ 5 cm and compare with conventional RFA (intratumoral puncture) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on percutaneous NtRFA for HCC â¤ 5 cm. The pooled proportions of the overall and cumulative incidence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years for LTP after NtRFA were assessed using a random-effects model. For studies comparing NtRFA with conventional RFA, relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were meta-analytically pooled with LTP as the outcome.

RESULTS:
Twelve studies with 900 patients were included. The pooled overall rate of LTP after NtRFA was 6% (95% CI, 4-8%). The pooled 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence rates of LTP were 3% (95% CI, 2-5%), 5% (95% CI, 3- 9%), and 8% (95% CI, 6-11%), respectively. Compared to conventional RFA, the pooled RR and HR of LTP were 0.26 (95% CI, 0.16-0.41) and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.11-0.70), respectively (both p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis including only randomized controlled studies also showed better local tumor control of NtRFA with HR of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.14-0.42).

CONCLUSIONS:
Percutaneous NtRFA is an effective treatment for HCC â¤ 5 cm with an overall LTP rate of 6% and provides lower LTP compared with conventional RFA.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,"What is the optimal management of thromboprophylaxis after liver transplantation regarding prevention of bleeding, hepatic artery, or portal vein thrombosis? A systematic review of the literature and expert panel recommendations.","BACKGROUND:
A key tenet of clinical management of patients post liver transplantation (LT) is the prevention of thrombotic and bleeding complications. This systematic review investigated the optimal management of thromboprophylaxis after LT regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) or hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and prevention of bleeding.

METHODS:
Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and recommendations using the GRADE approach derived from an international expert panel. Seven databases were used to conduct extensive literature searches focusing on the use of anticoagulation in LT and its impact on the following outcomes: PVT, HAT, and bleeding (CRD42021244288).

RESULTS:
Of the 2478 articles/abstracts screened, 16 studies were included in the final review. All articles were critically appraised by a panel of independent reviewers. There was wide variation regarding the anticoagulation protocols used. Thromboprophylaxis with therapeutic doses of heparin/Vitamin K antagonist combination did not decrease the risk of de novo or the recurrence of PVT but was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in some studies. Only the use of aspirin resulted in a small but significant decrease in the incidence of HAT post-LT, yet it did not increase the risk of bleeding.

CONCLUSIONS:
Based on existing data and expert opinion, thromboprophylaxis at therapeutic or prophylactic dose is not recommended for prevention of de novo PVT following LT in patients not at high risk. Aspirin should be considered as the standard of care following LT to prevent HAT.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Is metabolic syndrome a risk factor in hepatectomy? A meta-analysis with subgroup analysis for histologically confirmed hepatic manifestations.,"BACKGROUND:
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a risk factor in surgery. MetS can progress to metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a vast-growing etiology of primary liver tumors which are major indications for liver surgery. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of MetS on complications and long-term outcomes after hepatectomy.

METHODS:
The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO prior to data extraction. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for publications on liver resections and MetS. Comparative studies were included. Outcomes encompassed postoperative complications, mortality, and long-term oncologic status. Data were pooled as odds ratio (OR) with a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool (QUIPS), and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated with GRADE. Subgroup analyses for patients with histopathologically confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus controls were performed.

RESULTS:
The meta-analyses included fifteen comparative studies. Patients with MetS suffered significantly more overall complications (OR 1.55; 95% CI [1.05; 2.29]; p=0.03), major complications (OR 1.97 95% CI [1.13; 3.43]; p=0.02; I<sup>2</sup>=62%), postoperative hemorrhages (OR 1.76; 95% CI [1.23; 2.50]; p=0.01) and infections (OR 1.63; 95% CI [1.03; 2.57]; p=0.04). There were no significant differences in mortality, recurrence, 1- or 5-year overall or recurrence-free survivals. Patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD did not have significantly more overall complications; however, PHLF rates were increased (OR 4.87; 95% CI [1.22; 19.47]; p=0.04). Recurrence and survival outcomes did not differ significantly. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome ranged from low to very low.

CONCLUSION:
Patients with MetS that undergo liver surgery suffer more complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage and infection but not liver-specific complications-PHLF and biliary leakage. Histologically confirmed NAFLD is associated with significantly higher PHLF rates, yet, survivals of these patients are similar to patients without the MetS. Further studies should focus on identifying the tipping point for increased risk in patients with MetS-associated liver disease, as well as reliable markers of MAFLD stages and early markers of PHLF.

PROSPERO Nr: CRD42021253768.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a risk factor in surgery. MetS can progress to metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a vast-growing etiology of primary liver tumors which are major indications for liver surgery. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of MetS on complications and long-term outcomes after hepatectomy.","The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO prior to data extraction. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for publications on liver resections and MetS. Comparative studies were included. Outcomes encompassed postoperative complications, mortality, and long-term oncologic status. Data were pooled as odds ratio (OR) with a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool (QUIPS), and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated with GRADE. Subgroup analyses for patients with histopathologically confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus controls were performed.","The meta-analyses included fifteen comparative studies.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Is there an association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cognitive function? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is represented as the most common liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors underpinned by insulin resistance, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, leading to extrahepatic changes in central nervous diseases such as cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The aim of the review is to explore the association between NAFLD and cognitive function.

METHODS:
Using the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic electronic literature search was conducted in four databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase and CINAHL from inception until March 2021. Neuropsychological tests utilised within each study were grouped into relevant cognitive domains including 'general cognition', 'reasoning', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', 'memory and learning', 'language', 'visuospatial perception' and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'.

RESULTS:
Eleven observational studies that involved 7978 participants with a mean age of 51âyears were included. Those with NAFLD had poor cognitive performance in three cognitive domains, including 'general cognition', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'.

CONCLUSION:
The observed results from the 11 included studies showed that NAFLD was associated with lower cognitive performance across several domains. However, studies conducted to date are limited to observational designs and are heterogeneous with varying diagnostic tools used to assess cognitive function.

gastroenterology,hepatic disease,Does moderate alcohol consumption accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD? A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"OBJECTIVES:
Liver disease is a leading cause of premature death, partly driven by the increasing incidence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Many people with a diagnosis of NAFLD drink moderate amounts of alcohol. There is limited guidance for clinicians looking to advise these patients on the effect this will have on their liver disease progression. This review synthesises the evidence on moderate alcohol consumption and its potential to predict liver disease progression in people with diagnosed NAFLD.

METHODS:
A systematic review of longitudinal observational cohort studies was conducted. Databases (Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched up to September 2020. Studies were included that reported progression of liver disease in adults with NAFLD, looking at moderate levels of alcohol consumption as the exposure of interest. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic factor Studies tool.

RESULTS:
Of 4578 unique citations, 6 met the inclusion criteria. Pooling of data was not possible due to heterogeneity and studies were analysed using narrative synthesis. Evidence suggested that any level of alcohol consumption is associated with worsening of liver outcomes in NAFLD, even for drinking within recommended limits. Well conducted population based studies estimated up to a doubling of incident liver disease outcomes in patients with NAFLD drinking at moderate levels.

CONCLUSIONS:
This review found that any level of alcohol intake in NAFLD may be harmful to liver health.Study heterogeneity in definitions of alcohol exposure as well as in outcomes limited quantitative pooling of results. Use of standardised definitions for exposure and outcomes would support future meta-analysis.Based on this synthesis of the most up to date longitudinal evidence, clinicians seeing patients with NAFLD should currently advise abstinence from alcohol.

The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of rifaximin and nonabsorbable disaccharides (NADs) in hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

METHODS:
After the registration of the present meta-analysis on INPLASY, all procedures were performed according to PRISMA 2020. Relevant literature was retrieved on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to September 5, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the enrolled studies, and Review Manager software (version 5.3) was used to analyze the clinical efficacy, blood ammonia and adverse effects.

RESULTS:
Six studies with 559 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in the basic characteristics of the included studies. Analysis of the complete resolution of HE showed that rifaximin was better than NADs (risk ratio [RR]â=â1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]â=â1.03-3.39, Pâ=â.04). However, there were no significant differences in mental status (RRâ=â1.04, 95% CIâ=â0.92-1.18, Pâ=â.53), blood ammonia level (standard mean differenceâ=â-0.02, 95% CIâ=â-0.40-0.02, Pâ=â.08), or drug adverse drug effects (ORâ=â0.43, 95% CIâ=â0.10-1.77, I2â=â56%, Pâ=â.24) between the rifaximin and NADs treatment groups.

gastroenterology,inflammatory bowel disease,Is diversion free ileal pouch-anal anastomosis a safe procedure? A meta-analysis of 4973 cases.,"PURPOSE:
Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been established as the procedure of choice for patients who require excision of the colon and rectum for familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis. The requirement for proximal stomal diversion in IPAA is controversial.

OBJECTIVES:
To compare post-operative outcomes following IPAA with and without proximal diversion.

METHODS:
Computerised literature search, of Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE. Full-text comparative studies published between 1992 and 2019, in English language and on adult patients. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with or without proximal stomal diversion following proctocolectomy. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, anastomosis strictures, re-operations, pouch failure, intra-abdominal sepsis, small bowel obstruction/ileus and mortality.

RESULTS:
Five hundred and forty-six studies were screened. Fourteen relevant studies included 4973 cases (1832 patients with no stomas vs 3141 with stomas). Anastomotic strictures (pÂ â¤Â 0.0001 OR 0.40; 95% CI (0.26-0.62)) and pouch failures (pâ=â0.003 OR 0.54; 95% CI (0.36-0.82)) were higher in diverted than non-diverted patients. Re-operation was more frequently required in non-diverted patients (pÂ =â0.02 OR 2.51; 95% CI (1.12-5.59)). Heterogeneity was low in 5 out of 7 variables.

CONCLUSION:
In selected patients, diversion-free IPAA is a safe procedure associated with lower anastomotic stricture and pouch failure rates than diverted IPAA. This appears to occur at the expense of a higher re-operation rate. An RCT is required to help define the selection criteria.",To compare post-operative outcomes following IPAA with and without proximal diversion.,"Computerised literature search, of Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy for cytomegalovirus after liver transplantation?: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
To conduct a meta-analysis with the aim of comparing the outcomes of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients.

METHODS:
We searched databases for qualified studies up until March 2022. Finally, a meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity.

RESULTS:
With a total of 1834 LT patients, the pooled incidence of CMV infection and CMV disease in the overall LT recipients using antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy were 24.7% vs. 40.4% and 6.4% vs. 9.4%, respectively. Our meta-analysis exhibited a significant reduction in the incidence of CMV infection due to antiviral prophylaxis when compared to preemptive therapy in the high-risk group (OR: 6.67, 95% CI: 1.73, 25.66; p = 0.006). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of late-onset of CMV disease in preemptive therapy compared to antiviral prophylaxis in the high-risk group (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.74; p = 0.009). However, the incidence of CMV disease, allograft rejection, graft loss, drug related adverse effects, opportunistic infections and mortality did not differ significantly between both the interventions (all p> 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
We found the use of antiviral prophylaxis, compared with preemptive therapy, is superior in controlling CMV infection and prolonging the time to CMV disease in LT recipients without an increased risk of opportunistic infections, allograft rejection, graft loss, drug related adverse effects, development of drug resistance, and mortality.",To conduct a meta-analysis with the aim of comparing the outcomes of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients.,"We searched databases for qualified studies up until March 2022.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,What is the optimal anesthetic monitoring regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after liver transplantation?-A systematic review of the literature and expert panel recommendations.,"BACKGROUND:
Liver transplant centers vary in approach to intraoperative vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and temperature management. Evidence is limited regarding impact of selected modalities on postoperative outcomes.

OBJECTIVES:
To review the literature and provide expert panel recommendations on optimal intraoperative arterial blood pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), and vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and intraoperative temperature management regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

METHODS:
Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and recommendations using the GRADE approach derived from an international expert panel. Recommendations made for: (1) Vascular accesses, arterial BP and CVP monitoring, (2) cardiac function monitoring, and (3) Intraoperative temperature management (CRD42021239908).

RESULTS:
Of 2619 articles screened 16 were included. Studies were small, retrospective, and observational. Vascular access studies demonstrated low rates of insertion complications. TEE studies demonstrated low rates of esophageal hemorrhage. One study found lower hospital-LOS and 30-day mortality in patients monitored with both PAC and TEE. Other monitoring studies were heterogenous in design and outcomes. Temperature studies showed increased blood transfusion and ventilation times in hypothermic groups.

CONCLUSIONS:
Recommendations were made for; routine arterial and CVP monitoring as a minimum standard of practice, consideration of discrepancy between peripheral and central arterial BP in patients with hemodynamic instability and high vasopressor requirements, and routine use of high flow cannulae while monitoring for extravasation and hematoma formation. Availability and expertise in PAC and/or TEE monitoring is strongly recommended particularly in hemodynamic instability, portopulmonary HT and/or cardiac dysfunction. TEE use is recommended as an acceptable risk in patients with treated esophageal varices and is an effective diagnostic tool for emergency cardiovascular collapse. Maintenance of intraoperative normothermia is strongly recommended.","To review the literature and provide expert panel recommendations on optimal intraoperative arterial blood pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), and vascular accesses, monitoring of cardiac function and intraoperative temperature management regarding immediate and short-term outcomes after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).","Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and recommendations using the GRADE approach derived from an international expert panel.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Are We Ready for Bariatric Surgery in a Liver Transplant Program? A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are two main causes of end-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplantation. Studies exploring bariatric surgery in the liver transplantation setting have increased in recent years; however, a systematic analysis of the topic is lacking to date. This meta-analysis was conducted to explore the perioperative and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese patients undergoing liver transplantation.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies reporting bariatric surgery in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The primary outcomes were postoperative complications and mortality. We also extracted data about excess weight loss, body mass index, and improvement of comorbidities after bariatric surgery.

RESULTS:
A total of 96 patients from 8 articles were included. Bariatric surgery-related morbidity and mortality rates were 37% (95% CI 0.27-0.47) and 0.6% (95% CI 0.02-0.13), respectively. Body mass index at 24Â months was 31.02 (95% CI 25.96-36.09) with a percentage excess weight loss at 12 and 24Â months of 44.08 (95% CI 27.90-60.26) and 49.2 (95% CI 31.89-66.66), respectively. After bariatric surgery, rates of improvement of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 61% (95% CI 0.45-0.75) and 45% (95% CI 0.25-0.66), respectively. In most patients, bariatric surgery was performed after liver transplant and the most frequent technique was sleeve gastrectomy.

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Is hepatitis B immunoglobulin necessary in prophylaxis of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:
Application of nucleoside analogues and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) has reduced hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence rate after liver transplantation (LT) dramatically. Recent data suggests therapy without HBIG is also effective. We sought to evaluate the necessity of HBIG in prophylaxis of HBV recurrence after LT.

METHODS:
A meta-analysis was performed. PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge and other databases were searched for eligible literatures. The major end points were recurrence rate, patient survival, and YMDD mutant. Risk difference (RD) or risk ratio (RR) was calculated to synthesize the results.

RESULTS:
Nineteen studies with a total of 1484 patients were included in this analysis. Application of HBIG was helpful to reduce HBV recurrence [P<0.001; RDâ=â0.16; 95% confidence interval (CI)(0.12, 0.20)] and virus mutants [P<0.001; RRâ=â3.13; 95%CI (1.86-5.26)], it also improved patients' 1-year [Pâ=â0.03; RDâ=â0.08; 95%CI (0.01, 0.15)] and 3-year survival rates [Pâ=â0.005; RDâ=â0.17; 95%CI(0.05, 0.28)]. No significant difference was found for patients' 5-year survival [Pâ=â0.46; RDâ=â-0.06; 95%CI (-0.21, 0.10)]. Sub-group analysis showed that in patients with positive pre-operative HBV DNA status, HBIG was necessary to reduce HBV recurrence rate (P<0.001; RDâ=â0.42; 95%CI (0.32, 0.52)). In patients with negative HBV DNA, combined therapy gained no significant advantages (Pâ=â0.18; RDâ=â0.06; 95%CI (-0.03, 0.14)).

gastroenterology,liver transplantation,Does adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy improve outcome of biliary atresia? Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
The role of adjuvant steroid therapy in the postoperative management of patients with biliary atresia (BA) is unclear.

OBJECTIVE:
To systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) on BA outcome.

METHODS:
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials andâor observational studies that examined the role of steroids on BA outcomes published between January 1969 and June 2010 was conducted. Studies were identified using the Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases.

RESULTS:
Sixteen observational studies and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were found. Four of the 16 observational studies (160 participants) and the RCT (73 participants) met the entry criteria and were eligible to be included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the effect of steroids either on normalizing serum bilirubin levels at six months (pooled OR 1.48 [95% CI 0.67 to 3.28]) or in delaying the need for early liver transplantation (within the first year post-KP (pooled OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.21 to 1.72]).

CONCLUSION:
The present meta-analysis did not find a significant effect of steroid over standard therapy, either in normalizing serum bilirubin levels at six months or at delaying the need for early liver transplantation post-KP. RCT studies of sufficient size and comprehensive design using high-dose steroids are needed to determine the effectiveness of steroids on the short and intermediate post-KP outcomes for BA patients.",To systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of adjuvant steroid therapy post-Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) on BA outcome.,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials andâor observational studies that examined the role of steroids on BA outcomes published between January 1969 and June 2010 was conducted.

gastroenterology,malabsorption syndromes,Is Helicobacter pylori Infection Associated with Celiac Disease? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Some studies have reported the correlation between Helicobacter pylori and celiac disease (CD), but the results lack consistency. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between H. pylori and CD. In addition, the study also analyzed the impact of H. pylori on the symptoms and classification of CD.

METHODS:
Studies published up to September 1, 2020 on 3 databases - EMBASE, MEDICINE, and PubMed - were searched. The statistical data of articles which met the requirements were collated and extracted.

RESULTS:
Twenty-five papers and 141 355 participants were finally enrolled. The results showed that the H. pylori infection rate of CD patients was 0.57 times greater compared to controls (OR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.44, 0.75]), while statistical differences were also seen in the subgroups of children (OR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.33, 0.85]) and adults (OR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.49, 0.81]). Furthermore, patients having CD with H. pylori were more likely to have symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and distension (OR = 2.5, 95% CI [1.35, 4.62]) (OR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.09, 2.24]) (OR = 2.75, 95% CI [1.74, 4.35]). However, H. pylori has no effect on CD classification.

CONCLUSION:
The study confirmed that there is a correlation between H. pylori and CD, but the causality cannot be clarified. A demonstration of a causal role of H. pylori in CD in future prospective studies could have important therapeutic implications.","Some studies have reported the correlation between Helicobacter pylori and celiac disease (CD), but the results lack consistency.

gastroenterology,malabsorption syndromes,Does primary lactase deficiency reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"UNLABELLED:
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The role of primary lactase deficiency (PLD) in its development is not clear. This meta-analysis showed that PLD is a risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. These women need special attention in terms of screening for osteoporosis and its prevention.

INTRODUCTION:
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important predictor of bone fractures. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of association of PLD and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.

METHODS:
The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched over the course of July 2017 for any date of publication without language limitation. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the diagnosis of PLD was made by genetic testing or H-2 breath tests and the diagnosis of osteoporosis was made by a modern reliable method for BMD measurement. Two investigators conducted a comprehensive, independent review of all the papers. Five of the studies initially identified met the inclusion criteria. We used MOOSE guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model.

RESULTS:
Five case-control studies with 2223 participants and 763 lactase-deficient cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed a significantly higher bone density Z-score in absorbers (mean difference 0.20, CI (0.14-0.27), Pâ=â0.000), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies. Moreover, the Z-score in the vast majority of the measured sites (femoral head, femoral neck, lumbar spine, radius, and Ward's triangle) was significantly higher in absorbers. There was no significant overall difference in BMD in g/cm<sup>2</sup> between absorbers and non-absorbers, but a significantly higher BMD using g/cm<sup>2</sup> was observed in absorbers in the total hip site.

CONCLUSIONS:
Postmenopausal women with PLD had lower Z-scores at most anatomic sites compared to healthy controls.",Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important predictor of bone fractures. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of association of PLD and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.,"The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched over the course of July 2017 for any date of publication without language limitation. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the diagnosis of PLD was made by genetic testing or H-2 breath tests and the diagnosis of osteoporosis was made by a modern reliable method for BMD measurement. Two investigators conducted a comprehensive, independent review of all the papers. Five of the studies initially identified met the inclusion criteria. We used MOOSE guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model.","Five case-control studies with 2223 participants and 763 lactase-deficient cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed a significantly higher bone density Z-score in absorbers (mean difference 0.20, CI (0.14-0.27), Pâ=â0.000), with no significant heterogeneity among the studies. Moreover, the Z-score in the vast majority of the measured sites (femoral head, femoral neck, lumbar spine, radius, and Ward's triangle) was significantly higher in absorbers. There was no significant overall difference in BMD in g/cm<sup>2</sup> between absorbers and non-absorbers, but a significantly higher BMD using g/cm<sup>2</sup> was observed in absorbers in the total hip site.",Postmenopausal women with PLD had lower Z-scores at most anatomic sites compared to healthy controls.,30009335,"['24443063', '26715083', '18568133']","['10.1055/s-0034-1384629', '10.1056/NEJMcp1513724', '10.3390/nu7095340', '10.3390/nu7095380', '10.3390/nu7095332', '10.1155/2014/464382', '10.1177/2050640613484463', '10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000125', '10.1093/qjmed/hcq082', '10.1080/07315724.1998.10718813', '10.1080/07315724.1998.10718813', '10.1038/ejcn.2016.80', '10.1016/j.jneb.2013.11.018', '10.1139/apnm-2012-0368', '10.1093/ajcn/42.6.1197', '10.7762/cnr.2015.4.1.1', '10.1371/journal.pone.0043978', '10.1371/journal.pone.0043978', '10.1053/gast.2002.33600', '10.1002/jbmr.5650061214', '10.1007/s005350200171', '10.2217/whe.15.94', '10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181f44abc', '10.1192/bjp.bp.111.106666', '10.1192/bjp.bp.111.106666', '10.1186/1471-2288-5-13', '10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602219', '10.1079/BJN19950050', '10.1007/s00223-010-9361-4', '10.1007/s00198-008-0709-9', '10.1359/jbmr.0301207', '10.1038/ncprheum0928', '10.1007/s00198-012-2074-y', '10.1016/j.jocd.2013.09.006']",Does primary lactase deficiency reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women?,1/28/2019,Does primary lactase deficiency reduce bone mineral density in postmenopausal women?,"Several studies showed  significantly higher bone density Z-score in absorbers with no significant heterogeneity among the studies.

gastroenterology,pancreatic disease,Is aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation beneficial in acute pancreatitis? A meta-analysis of randomized control trials and cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND:
There is conflincting evidence on the intravenous fluid (IVF) strategy for acute pancreatitis (AP). We perform a metaanalysis of the available evidence.

AIM:
To investigate if aggressive IVF therapy in AP patients is beneficial to decrease mortality and improve outcomes.

METHODS:
Metaanalysis of available randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing aggressive IVF <i>vs</i> non-aggressive IVF resuscitation.

RESULTS:
There was no significant difference in mortality between the aggressive (<i>n</i> = 1229) and non-aggressive IVF (<i>n</i> = 1397) patients. Patients receiving aggressive IVF therapy had higher risk for acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There also was no significant difference in the overall incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, persistent organ failure, pancreatic necrosis when comparing both study groups.

CONCLUSION:
Early aggressive IVF therapy did not improve mortality. Moreover, aggressive IVF therapy could potentially increase the risk for acute kidney injury and pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Studies are needed to investigate which subset of AP patients could benefit from aggressive IVF therapy.",There is conflincting evidence on the intravenous fluid (IVF) strategy for acute pancreatitis (AP).

gastroenterology,pancreatic disease,Is total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy superior to open procedure? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Laparoscopy has been widely used in general surgical procedures, but total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (TLPD) is still a complex and challenging surgery that is only performed in a small number of patients at a few large academic medical centers. Although the safety and feasibility of TLPD have been established, few studies have compared it with open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) with regard to perioperative and oncological outcomes. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate whether TLPD is superior to OPD.

AIM:
To compare the treatment outcomes of TLPD and OPD in order to assess the safety and feasibility of TLPD.

METHODS:
We conducted a systematic search of studies comparing TLPD with OPD that were published in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through December 31, 2018. The studies comparing TLPD and OPD with at least one of the outcomes we were interested in and with more than 10 cases in each group were included in this analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the nonrandomized controlled trials and the Jadad scale was used to assess the randomized controlled trials. Intraoperative data, postoperative complications, and oncologic outcomes were evaluated. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager Software version 5.3. Random or fixed-effects meta-analyses were undertaken to measure the pooled estimates.

RESULTS:
A total of 4790 articles were initially identified for our study. After screening, 4762 articles were excluded and 28 studies representing 39771 patients (3543 undergoing TLPD and 36228 undergoing OPD) were eventually included. Patients who underwent TLPD had less intraoperative blood loss [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -260.08 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI): (-336.02, -184.14) mL, <i>P</i> < 0.00001], a lower blood transfusion rate [odds ratio (OR) = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.36-0.72, <i>P</i> = 0.0001], a lower perioperative overall morbidity (OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73-0.92, <i>P</i> = 0.0008), a lower wound infection rate (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.34-0.67, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), a lower pneumonia rate (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.60-0.85, <i>P</i> = 0.0002), a shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay [WMD = -0.28 d, 95%CI (-2.88, -1.29) d, <i>P</i> < 0.00001] and a shorter length of hospital stay [WMD = -3.05 d, 95%CI (-3.93, -2.17), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], a lower rate of discharge to a new facility (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.39-0.78, <i>P</i> = 0.0008), and a lower 30-d readmission rate (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.68-0.95, <i>P</i> = 0.10) than those who underwent OPD. In addition, the TLPD group had a higher R0 rate (OR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.13-1.44, <i>P</i> = 0.0001) and more lymph nodes harvested (WMD = 1.32, 95%CI: 0.57-2.06, <i>P</i> = 0.0005) than the OPD group. However, the patients who underwent TLPD experienced a significantly longer operative time (WMD = 77.92 min, 95%CI: 40.89-114.95, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) and had a smaller tumor size than those who underwent OPD [WMD = -0.32 cm, 95%CI: (-0.58, -0.07) cm, <i>P</i> = 0.01]. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the major morbidity, postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, bile leak, gastroenteric anastomosis fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, bowel obstruction, fluid collection, reoperation, ICU admission, or 30-d and 90-d mortality rates. For malignant tumors, the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates were not significantly different between the two groups.

CONCLUSION:
This meta-analysis indicates that TLPD is safe and feasible, and may be a desirable alternative to OPD, although a longer operative time is needed and only smaller tumors can be treated.","Laparoscopy has been widely used in general surgical procedures, but total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (TLPD) is still a complex and challenging surgery that is only performed in a small number of patients at a few large academic medical centers.

medical genetics,genetic testing,Can Comprehensive Chromosome Screening Technology Improve IVF/ICSI Outcomes? A Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE:
To examine whether comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) for preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has an effect on improving in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) outcomes compared to traditional morphological methods.

METHODS:
A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI and ClinicalTrials.gov up to May 2015. Two reviewers independently evaluated titles and abstracts, extracted data and assessed quality. We included studies that compared the IVF/ICSI outcomes of CCS-based embryo selection with those of the traditional morphological method. Relative risk (RR) values with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in RevMan 5.3, and subgroup analysis and Begg's test were used to assess heterogeneity and potential publication bias, respectively.

RESULTS:
Four RCTs and seven cohort studies were included. A meta-analysis of the outcomes showed that compared to morphological criteria, euploid embryos identified by CCS were more likely to be successfully implanted (RCT RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.18-1.47; cohort study RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.35-2.24). CCS-based PGS was also related to an increased clinical pregnancy rate (RCT RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.83-1.93; cohort study RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.83), an increased ongoing pregnancy rate (RCT RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.64-2.66; cohort study RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.30-2.00), and an increased live birth rate (RCT RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.50; cohort study RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85-2.13) as well as a decreased miscarriage rate (RCT RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.24-1.15; cohort study RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21-0.46) and a decreased multiple pregnancy rate (RCT RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.26; cohort study RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.51). The results of the subgroup analysis also showed a significantly increased implantation rate in the CCS group.

CONCLUSIONS:
The effectiveness of CCS-based PGS is comparable to that of traditional morphological methods, with better outcomes for women receiving IVF/ICSI technology. The transfer of both trophectoderm-biopsied and blastomere-biopsied CCS-euploid embryos can improve the implantation rate.",To examine whether comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) for preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has an effect on improving in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) outcomes compared to traditional morphological methods.,"A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI and ClinicalTrials.gov up to May 2015.

medical genetics,genetic epidemiology,Which Risk Factors Causally Influence Dementia? A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Numerous risk factors for dementia are well established, though the causal nature of these associations remains unclear.

OBJECTIVE:
To systematically review Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigating causal relationships between risk factors and global cognitive function or dementia.

METHODS:
We searched five databases from inception to February 2017 and conducted citation searches including MR studies investigating the association between any risk factor and global cognitive function, all-cause dementia or dementia subtypes. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, full-texts, and study quality.

RESULTS:
We included 18 MR studies investigating education, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular factors and related biomarkers, diabetes related and other endocrine factors, and telomere length. Studies were of predominantly good quality, however eight received low ratings for sample size and statistical power. The most convincing causal evidence was found for an association of shorter telomeres with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Causal evidence was weaker for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Well-replicated associations were not present for most exposures and we cannot fully discount survival and diagnostic bias, or the potential for pleiotropic effects.

CONCLUSIONS:
Genetic evidence supported a causal association between telomere length and AD, whereas limited evidence for other risk factors was largely inconclusive with tentative evidence for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, and selected metabolic markers. The lack of stronger evidence for other risk factors may reflect insufficient statistical power. Larger well-designed MR studies would therefore help establish the causal status of these dementia risk factors.",To systematically review Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigating causal relationships between risk factors and global cognitive function or dementia.,"We searched five databases from inception to February 2017 and conducted citation searches including MR studies investigating the association between any risk factor and global cognitive function, all-cause dementia or dementia subtypes.

medical genetics,genetic inheritance patterns,Does Childhood Trauma Moderate Polygenic Risk for Depression? A Meta-analysis of 5765 Subjects From the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.,"BACKGROUND:
The heterogeneity of genetic effects on major depressive disorder (MDD) may be partly attributable to moderation of genetic effects by environment, such as exposure to childhood trauma (CT). Indeed, previous findings in two independent cohorts showed evidence for interaction between polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and CT, albeit in opposing directions. This study aims to meta-analyze MDD-PRSÂ Ã CT interaction results across these two and other cohorts, while applying more accurate PRSs based on a larger discovery sample.

METHODS:
Data were combined from 3024 MDD cases and 2741 control subjects from nine cohorts contributing to the MDD Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. MDD-PRS were based on a discovery sample of â¼110,000 independent individuals. CT was assessed as exposure to sexual or physical abuse during childhood. In a subset of 1957 cases and 2002 control subjects, a more detailed five-domain measure additionally included emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect.

RESULTS:
MDD was associated with the MDD-PRS (odds ratio [OR]Â = 1.24, pÂ = 3.6Â Ã 10<sup>-5</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>Â = 1.18%) and with CT (ORÂ = 2.63, pÂ = 3.5Â Ã 10<sup>-18</sup> and ORÂ = 2.62, pÂ = 1.4Â Ã10<sup>-5</sup> for the two- and five-domain measures, respectively). No interaction was found between MDD-PRS and the two-domain and five-domain CT measure (ORÂ = 1.00, pÂ = .89 and ORÂ = 1.05, pÂ = .66).

CONCLUSIONS:
No meta-analytic evidence for interaction between MDD-PRS and CT was found. This suggests that the previously reported interaction effects, although both statistically significant, can best be interpreted as chance findings. Further research is required, but this study suggests that the genetic heterogeneity of MDD is not attributable to genome-wide moderation of genetic effects by CT.","The heterogeneity of genetic effects on major depressive disorder (MDD) may be partly attributable to moderation of genetic effects by environment, such as exposure to childhood trauma (CT).

medical genetics,genetic risk assessment,Are the FTO Gene Polymorphisms Associated with Colorectal Cancer? A Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is reported to be associated with some gene polymorphisms. However, the effect of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene on colorectal cancer is not yet clear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association of the FTO gene polymorphism and colorectal cancer.

METHODS:
PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, and Embase were explored to identify the studies investigating the relationship between rs9939609 and rs17817449 polymorphisms of FTO gene and colorectal cancer, and the published papers from 2000 to 2019Â were collected. This meta-analysis was conducted by using a random-effects model for the best estimation of the desired outcomes.

RESULTS:
In this study, 1528 studies were initially included and five eligible case-control studies including 13,460 cases and 22,578 controls were eligible for further analyses. No significant association was found between risk allele of FTO rs9939609 (ORâ=â0.98, 0.87-1.1) and rs17817449 (ORâ=â0.9, 0.79-1.03) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk. The subgroup analyses considering the source of the control group and race found no significant association between FTO polymorphisms and the risk of colon cancer.

CONCLUSIONS:
This study indicated that rs9939609 and rs17817449 FTO gene polymorphisms are not associated with colorectal cancer risk. Individual studies involving different FTO polymorphisms are needed to further evaluation of the associations between the FTO gene and colon cancer.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is reported to be associated with some gene polymorphisms.

medical genetics,genetic risk assessment,"""What are my chances of developing COPD if one of my parents has the disease?"" A systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of co-occurrence of COPD diagnosis in parents and offspring.","INTRODUCTION:
Intergenerational associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been well recognized and may result from genetic, gene environment, or exposure to life course factors. Consequently, adult offspring of parents with COPD may be at a greater risk of developing COPD. The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of co-occurrence of COPD in adult offspring with one or both parents having COPD independent of specific genetic variations.

METHODS:
In total, five databases were searched for original studies in which prevalence of COPD was reported in both offspring (children) and one or both parents. Studies were excluded if COPD was not clearly defined, COPD was linked to specific genetic variations, COPD was combined with other chronic respiratory conditions, or estimates included other first-degree relatives. Data extraction (ie, sample characteristics, prevalence of COPD, and odds ratio [OR] if reported) was completed by two independent reviewers. A meta-analysis of prevalence and OR was conducted, where possible.

RESULTS:
Of the 3,382 citations, 129 full texts were reviewed to include eight studies (six case-control, one cross-sectional, and one cohort) reflecting either prevalence of COPD in offspring of parents with COPD (descendent approach, n=3), which ranged from 0% to 17.3%, or prevalence of people with COPD reporting positive parental history of COPD (antecedent approach, n=5), for which the pooled prevalence was 28.6%. Offspring of people with COPD had 1.57 times greater odds (95% confidence interval =1.29-1.93; <i>P</i><0.001) of having COPD compared with people not having a parental history of COPD.

CONCLUSION:
The prevalence of COPD in adult offspring of people with COPD is greater than population-based estimates, and the ORs indicate a higher risk in this group. This offers clinicians a potential strategy for opportunistic screening, early identification, and intervention in this at-risk group.","Intergenerational associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been well recognized and may result from genetic, gene environment, or exposure to life course factors.

medical genetics,genetic risk assessment,Is birthweight associated with total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer risks? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
It has been hypothesised that intrauterine exposures are important for subsequent prostate cancer risk. Prior epidemiological studies have used birthweight as a proxy of cumulative intrauterine exposures to test this hypothesis, but results have been inconsistent partly because of limited statistical power.

METHODS:
We investigated birthweight in relation to prostate cancer in the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) using Cox proportional hazards models. We then conducted a meta-analysis of birthweight in relation to total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer risks, combining results from the NSHD analysis with 13 additional studies on this relationship identified from a systematic search in four major scientific literature databases through January 2015.

RESULTS:
Random-effects models found that per kg increase in birthweight was positively associated with total (OR=1.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.00, 1.05; I(2)=13%) and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer (OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.99, 1.19; I(2)=40%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with birthweight extracted from medical records demonstrated stronger positive associations with total (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03, 1.19; I(2)=0%) and aggressive/lethal (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.09, 1.74; I(2)=0%) prostate cancer. These studies heavily overlapped with those based in Nordic countries.

CONCLUSIONS:
This study provides evidence that heavier birthweight may be associated with modest increased risks of total and aggressive/lethal prostate cancer, which supports the hypothesis that intrauterine exposures may be related to subsequent prostate cancer risks.","It has been hypothesised that intrauterine exposures are important for subsequent prostate cancer risk.

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the immune system,Is there an increased risk of post-operative surgical site infection after orthopaedic surgery in HIV patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
There is dilemma as to whether patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requiring implant orthopaedic surgery are at an increased risk for post-operative surgical site infection (SSI). We conducted a systematic review to determine the effect of HIV on the risk of post-operative SSI and sought to determine if this risk is altered by antibiotic use beyond 24 hours.

METHODS:
We searched electronic databases, manually searched citations from relevant articles, and reviewed conference proceedings. The risk of postoperative SSI was pooled using Mantel-Haenszel method.

RESULTS:
We identified 18 cohort studies with 16 mainly small studies, addressing the subject. The pooled risk ratio of infection in the HIV patients when compared to non-HIV patients was 1.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.3-2.4), in studies in Africa this was 2.3 (95% CI 1.5-3.5). In a sensitivity analysis the risk ratio was reduced to 1.4 (95% CI 0.5-3.8). The risk ratio of infection in patients receiving prolonged antibiotics compared to patients receiving antibiotics for up to 24 hours was 0.7 (95% CI 0.1-4.2).

CONCLUSIONS:
The results may indicate an increased risk in HIV infected patients but these results are not robust and inconclusive after conducting the sensitivity analysis removing poor quality studies. There is need for larger good quality studies to provide conclusive evidence. To better develop surgical protocols, further studies should determine the effect of reduced CD4 counts, viral load suppression and prolonged antibiotics on the risk for infection.",There is dilemma as to whether patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requiring implant orthopaedic surgery are at an increased risk for post-operative surgical site infection (SSI).

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the nervous system,Does CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect neurological deterioration in stroke/TIA patients?: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND:
The association between cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphisms and neurological deterioration in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients is not completely understood. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to quantify this association.

METHODS:
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases were searched for studies published up to April 2019. Prospective cohort studies that reported an association between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and neurological deterioration in stroke/TIA patients were included. Data on risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled by the authors. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed.

RESULTS:
Twelve eligible studies were included. Twelve studies reported CYP2C19â2, â3 loss-of-function alleles and 5 studies reported CYP2C19â17 gain-of-function allele. Compared to non-carriers, carriers of CYP2C19â2, â3 loss-of-function alleles had a significantly higher risk of neurological deterioration (RR, 1.63; 95%CI, 1.32-2.02). Conversely, carriers of CYP2C19â17 gain-of-function allele had a significantly lower risk of neurological deterioration (RR, 0.520; 95%CI, 0.393-0.689) compared to non-carriers.

CONCLUSIONS:
This meta-analysis demonstrated that the carriers of CYP2C19â2, â3 loss-of-function alleles have an increased risk of neurological deterioration compared to non-carriers in stroke or TIA patients. Additionally, CYP2C19â17 gain-of-function allele can reduce the risk of neurological deterioration.","The association between cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphisms and neurological deterioration in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients is not completely understood.

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the nervous system,When does postural instability appear in monogenic parkinsonisms? An individual-patient meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Postural instability is a disease milestone signaling advanced disease.

OBJECTIVES:
To estimate the onset of postural instability in monogenic parkinsonisms.

METHODS:
We systematically reviewed studies (PubMed 1996-2017) in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, ATP13A2, FBXO7, VPS35, DNAJC6, or SYNJ1-related monogenic parkinsonisms, with documented postural instability. Genes withââ¥â15 patients were included in an individual-patient meta-analysis and compared with a retrospectively collected sporadic Parkinson's disease cohort from our center. The primary outcome measure was the progression-free survival from postural instability using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazards analyses were summarized using hazards ratio (HR).

RESULTS:
Of 2085 eligible studies, 124 met full criteria (636 patients) for the systematic review, whereas a total of 871 subjects (270 from sporadic cohort, 601 monogenic parkinsonisms) were included in the individual-patient meta-analysis. Postural instability was reported in 80% of DJ-1, 40% of PRKN, 39% of PINK1, 34% of ATP13A2, 31% of LRRK2, and 29% of SNCA patients. Progression-free survival from postural instability at 10Â years after disease onset was longest in ATP13A2 (97%) and shortest in SNCA (50%). Halfway between these two extremes were PRKN (88%), PINK1 (87%), and LRRK2 (81%), similar to sporadic Parkinson's disease (72%). Higher risk of postural instability was observed in SNCA (HRâ=â3.2, pâ=â0.007) and DJ-1 (HRâ=â3.96, pâ=â0.001) compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. Young age at onset in PINK1 and female sex in LRRK2 were associated with a decreased risk of postural instability.

Monogenic parkinsonisms exhibit differential timelines to postural instability, informing prognostic counseling and interpretation of future genotype-specific treatment trials.",To estimate the onset of postural instability in monogenic parkinsonisms.,"We systematically reviewed studies (PubMed 1996-2017) in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, ATP13A2, FBXO7, VPS35, DNAJC6, or SYNJ1-related monogenic parkinsonisms, with documented postural instability.

medical genetics,genetic disorders of the nervous system,Are there shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD? A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.,"BACKGROUND:
Dyslexia and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (estimates of 25-40% bidirectional comorbidity). Previous work has identified strong genetic and cognitive overlap between the disorders, but neural overlap is relatively unexplored. This study is a systematic meta-analysis of existing voxel-based morphometry studies to determine whether there is any overlap in the gray matter correlates of both disorders.

METHODS:
We conducted anatomic likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry studies in which individuals with dyslexia (15 studies; 417 cases, 416 controls) or ADHD (22 studies; 898 cases, 763 controls) were compared to typically developing controls. We generated ALE maps for dyslexia vs. controls and ADHD vs. controls using more conservative (pâ<â.001, kâ=â50) and more lenient (pâ<â.005, kâ=â50) thresholds. To determine the overlap of gray matter correlates of dyslexia and ADHD, we examined the statistical conjunction between the ALE maps for dyslexia vs. controls and ADHD vs. controls (false discovery rate [FDR] pâ<â.05, kâ=â50, 5000 permutations).

RESULTS:
Results showed largely distinct gray matter differences associated with dyslexia and ADHD. There was no evidence of statistically significant gray matter overlap at our conservative threshold, and only one region of overlap in the right caudate at our more lenient threshold. Reduced gray matter in the right caudate may be relevant to shared cognitive correlates in executive functioning and/or procedural learning. The more general finding of largely distinct regional differences in gray matter between dyslexia and ADHD suggests that other neuroimaging modalities may be more sensitive to overlapping neural correlates, and that current neuroimaging recruitment approaches may be hindering progress toward uncovering neural systems associated with comorbidity.

CONCLUSIONS:
The current study is the first to meta-analyze overlap between gray matter differences in dyslexia and ADHD, which is a critical step toward constructing a multi-level understanding of this comorbidity that spans the genetic, neural, and cognitive levels of analysis.","Dyslexia and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (estimates of 25-40% bidirectional comorbidity).
