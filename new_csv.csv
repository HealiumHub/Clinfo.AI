0,prenatal mental disorders increase the risk of childhood asthma. ,"Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age. Studies suggested that these conditions might be related to prenatal depression or anxiety. This study aimed to explore the association between prenatal mental disorders and childhood asthma or atopic disease in a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Strong evidence suggests that prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in offspring, emphasizing the importance of monitoring maternal mental health during pregnancy."
1,"Reports of HIV/PvCo are scarce in the literature, with only a few studies describing clinical and laboratory outcomes. Systematic screening for both co-infections is not routinely performed, and therefore the real prevalence of HIV/PvCo is unknown. ","Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues. However, evidence on HIV-Plasmodium vivax co-infection (HIV/PvCo) is scarce, with most of the available information related to Plasmodium falciparum on the African continent. It is unclear whether HIV can change the clinical course of vivax malaria and increase the risk of complications. In this study, a systematic review of HIV/PvCo studies was performed, and recent cases from the Brazilian Amazon were included.","Evidence on Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection is limited and mixed, highlighting the need for further research to determine the true prevalence and clinical implications."
2,"Bladder cancer was diagnosed a median of 14 years after HIV-infection. Most patients were on ART (86%) with median current and nadir CD4 cell counts of 506 and 195 cells/mm3, respectively. Haematuria (73%) was the most frequent presenting symptom and HPV-associated lesions were seen in 6/10 (60%) patients. Histopathology showed transitional cell carcinoma in 80% and a high proportion of tumors with muscle invasion (47%) and high histologic grade (73%). One-year survival rate was 74.6%. The systematic review identified 13 additional cases of urothelial bladder cancers which shared similar features.

Bladder cancers in HIV-infected patients remain rare but may occur in relatively young patients with a low nadir CD4 cell count, have aggressive pathological features and can be fatal.","Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Albeit bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, it has been rarely reported among HIV-infected patients. We wished to assess the prevalence and characteristics of bladder cancer in HIV-infected patients.","Bladder cancer can occur in HIV-infected adults, potentially linked to factors like urinary schistosomiasis, emphasizing the need for vigilance in monitoring and early detection in this population."
3,"High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.","Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.","There is some evidence to suggest that having sex with other men may increase the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections, particularly HIV-1, but the data on other infections like HBV or HCV is inconclusive, highlighting the need for further research in Western countries."
4,Atopic dermatitis is the most commonly used term and appears to be increasing in popularity. Given that eczema is a nonspecific term that describes the morphological appearance of several forms of dermatitis,"The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. It also negatively impacts accurate communication of research in the scientific literature. We sought to determine the most commonly used terms for AD.","Atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, and eczema are frequently used interchangeably, but the term ""atopic dermatitis"" encompasses various clinical phenotypes and poses challenges in diagnosis due to its heterogeneity. The burden of atopic dermatitis is significant, and effective management involves categorizing subtypes, identifying triggers, and utilizing a range of therapies."
5,"Given the largely inconsistent picture within and across respiratory outcomes, it is impossible to determine whether or not omega-3 fatty acids are an efficacious adjuvant or monotherapy for children or adults","Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids. Given the interplay between pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, and the less pro-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, it has been thought that the latter could play a key role in treating or preventing asthma. The purpose was to systematically review the scientific-medical literature in order to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence for possible treatment effects of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma.","Evidence suggests potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, in managing inflammatory diseases like asthma, but clinical trials have shown inconsistent results. Ongoing large-scale trials may provide more clarity on the role of omega-3 supplementation in asthma treatment. "
6," Findings regarding sweet sensitivity were mixed. Three studies with cystic fibrosis patients (n = 1393) were included. Studies investigating the association between clinical outcomes and TAS2R38 alleles were limited, but the nonfunctional combination of AVI/AVI was associated with increased utilization of sinus surgery and, in CRSsNP patients, with poorer improvement of symptoms postoperatively.

Both genotypic and phenotypic assessments of T2Rs suggest a potential association with CRS, particularly CRSsNP. However, limited evidence and mixed conclusions cloud the role of T2Rs in CRS. Future investigations should aim to increase diverse populations, broaden institutional diversity, examine T1Rs, and utilize uniform assessments.","Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Growing evidence suggests extraoral TRs as relevant biomarkers, but the current understanding is incomplete. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence of extraoral taste receptors in CRS.","Taste receptors, especially bitter taste receptors like quinine sensitivity and TAS2R38, show promise as potential biomarkers for chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly in CRSwNP, but further research is needed to confirm their reliability and utility."
7,"ATS is associated with fewer complications, less use of epidural anesthesia, shorter length of stay and length of chest drainage, but longer operative time, as compared with thoracotomy. Symptomatic patients with CLM using VATS may be prone to conversion to thoracotomy",A meta-analysis was performed for a comparison of outcomes between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy for congenital lung malformations (CLM).,"Thoracoscopic approaches show promise in treating congenital lung malformations, but more high-quality studies are required to confirm superiority over thoracotomy."
8," Compared to the FICB, FNB decreased the VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and the incidence rate of some side effects (nausea, vomiting, and sedation) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, compared to the FICB, no significant difference was found in the FNB regarding the VAS scores postoperatively at any of the other time points (2âmin, 20âmin, 2âh, 24âh at movement, 48âh at rest, and 48âh at movement). Patients in both groups had similar narcotic needs after 24âh, mean arterial pressure, SA time, and patient satisfaction.

FNB has more advantages in reducing VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest and the odds of some adverse effects.","Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of FNB compared with FICB are yet to be fully determined.","Evidence suggests that femoral or pericapsular nerve group blocks may lead to lower postoperative opioid consumption compared to no nerve block in hip surgery, but femoral nerve block is associated with prolonged quadricipital paralysis."
9,"We found no differences between LAS and GA in terms of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and other endpoints that addressed safety and complication rates. LAS was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay and with lower rates of catecholamine administration and red blood cell transfusion. New pacemaker implantations occurred more frequently under LAS. The overall conversion rate from LAS to GA was 6.2%.

For TAVI, both LAS and GA are feasible and safe. LAS may have some benefits such as increased haemodynamic stability and shorter hospital and ICU stays, but it does not impact 30-day mortality.",We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the potential favourable effects of local anaesthesia plus sedation (LAS) compared with general anaesthesia (GA) in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).,"Evidence from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and observational studies suggests that local anesthesia is a favorable approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, showing benefits such as lower mortality, reduced procedural time, and fewer complications compared to general anesthesia."
10,"Pathways were identified covering analgesic management, respiratory care, surgical decision making and reducing risk of complications. Studies evaluating pathways are generally limited by their observational and retrospective design, but results highlight the potential benefits of pathway driven care provision in blunt thoracic injury.

The results demonstrate the complexity of evaluating patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury management. It is important that pathways undergo rigorous evaluation, refinement and validation to ensure quality and patient safety. Strong recommendations are precluded as the quality of the pathway evaluation studies are low.","Blunt thoracic injury is present in around 15% of all major trauma presentations. To ensure a standardised approach to the management of physical injury, patient pathway-based interventions have been established in many healthcare settings. It currently remains unclear how these complex interventions are implemented and evaluated in the literature. This systematic review aims to identify pathway effectiveness literature and implementation studies in relation to patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury care.",Patient pathway-based interventions in acute care of blunt thoracic injury show potential benefits but are limited by study design biases.
