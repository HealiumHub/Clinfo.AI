		"content": "The question \"Analyze further results in Zimbabwe?\" is addressed by examining the findings from the 2013-2014 Zimbabwe PMTCT Effectiveness Survey. The study assessed mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among adolescents, young women, and adult mothers in Zimbabwe. The survey included 1,171 HIV-infected mother-infant pairs and followed them until the infants were 18 months old. The results indicated that the 18-month cumulative MTCT risk was highest among adolescents (aged ≤19 years) at 12%, compared to 7.5% for young women (aged 20–24 years) and 6.9% for adult women (aged ≥25 years) (Burrage et al.).\n\nDespite similar coverage of antenatal care and HIV testing across age groups, adolescents had lower antiretroviral medication coverage during pregnancy (76.8%) compared to young women (83.8%) and adults (87.8%). Factors associated with no antiretroviral use during pregnancy included no antenatal care attendance, no HIV testing, and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy, but age itself was not a risk factor (Burrage et al.).\n\nThe study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the higher risk of MTCT in adolescents, despite the overall success of PMTCT programs in Zimbabwe. It suggests that additional research is needed to explore the causes of higher MTCT rates in adolescents and to develop tailored interventions to improve outcomes in this vulnerable group (Burrage et al.).\n\n",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nThe use of services to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a serious challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. In the last decade, Burkina Faso has implemented numerous policies to increase the use of PMTCT services by pregnant women and their partners, as well as children. This study assesses trends in the uptake of PMTCT services in Burkina Faso from 2013 to 2020 in order to study the progress and gaps in achieving the national and international targets set for 2020.\n\nMETHODS:\nA repeated cross-sectional analysis was performed using data extracted from district health information software version 2. Percentages were computed for each PMTCT indicator and comparisons between the years were made using a chi-square test for trends with a significance threshold of 5%. Regions were not compared with each other.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe proportion of pregnant women who were tested and received their results significantly increased from 47.9% in 2013 to 84.6% in 2020 (p value < 0.001). Of the 13 regions in the country, only 1 region met the 95% national targets whereas, 6 regions met the 90% international targets for this indicator. The proportions of HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased from 90.8% in 2013 to 100% in 2020. In the same period, the proportion of exposed infants who received antiretroviral prophylaxis increased from 64.3% in 2013 to 86.8% in 2020. Only 3 regions reached the national and international targets for this indicator. A positive trend was also observed for the indicator related to screening at 2 months or later of exposed infants using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technic; with the rate rising from 7.4% in 2013 to 75.7% in 2020. However, for this indicator, the national and international targets were not achieved considering the national and regional settings. Concerning the women's partners, the proportion of those who tested for HIV increased from 0.9% in 2013 to 4.5% in 2020, with only 1 region that fully met the national target of 10% in 2020. The prevalence of HIV in this particular group was 0.5% in 2020.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPMTCT indicators show an increase from 2013 to 2020 but with a strong disparity between regions. National and international targets have not been achieved for any indicator; except for those related to women receiving ART. Strengthening strategies to effectively engage women and their partners on the use of PMTCT cascade services could help reduce mother-to-child transmission in Burkina Faso.",

More than 90% of these infections occur via mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), roughly 50% of the infected children will die before their second birthday [1, 2]. Interventions during pregnancy, labour, delivery, and breastfeeding, collectively known as the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) cascade are effective in preventing the vertical transmission of HIV [3, 4]. The PMTCT cascade includes services aimed at virtually eliminating MTCT of HIV (Antenatal Care (ANC), HIV testing, disease staging, and ART), reducing child mortality (ARV prophylaxis, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, and Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections), and improving maternal health [5].\n\nWorldwide, around 1.4 million paediatric HIV infections were prevented from 2010 to 2018 because of PMTCT programs [6]. Also, because of PMTCT services, the proportion of children who acquired HIV infection from their mothers in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), plummeted from 18% in 2010 to 10% in 2017 [6]. In 2020, the worldwide expansion of access to PMTCT services resulted to 85% of pregnant women living with HIV who were receiving Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), preventing up to 220,000 new infants infections [4, 7]. Despite the global scale-up of PMTCT services, the pandemic continues to challenge maternal and paediatric services especially in SSA, where transmission through breastfeeding is responsible for more than half of all incident paediatric HIV infections and where many pregnant women miss some or all of the essential PMTCT services [8–10].\n\nThe prevention of HIV through PMTCT requires a multi-pronged approach which includes the HIV testing and treatment cascade for pregnant women and their infants [11]. The PMTCT cascade encompasses a series of key stepwise activities that constitute a critical pathway to successful PMTCT that begins with all pregnant women and ends with the detection of final HIV status in HIV-exposed infants [12]. It involves 18 months of care from the initial antenatal visit and HIV testing through ARV treatment, intra-partum care, infant testing, infant feeding education, and infant/mother treatment [13]. To further the global goal of the United Nations program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to eliminate MTCT by 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the adoption of the option B + and suggested that ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of the clinical stage and CD4 cell count, and continued throughout their lives [14].\n\nLike many other countries in SSA, Burkina Faso has implemented several programs to boost PMTCT services and improve maternal and child health (Fig. 1) [15]. The first PMTCT/HIV program was implemented between 2001 and 2005, and covered 15% of all health facilities. The second program was executed from 2006 to 2010 in 92% of the health facilities, and the third was carried out from 2011 to 2015 with effective implementation in 98.2% of the health facilities [16, 17]. The latter program integrated maternal health services with HIV testing and free ARV treatment [16]. Additionally, the option B + approach was effectively implemented in 2015, as was the decentralisation of the medical management of people living with HIV and the delegation of prescriptions to paramedics so that national and international targets could be achieved [18, 19].Fig. 1 Timeline of different programs in connection with PMTCT adopted in Burkina Faso\n\nThe objectives of national targets aiming at the elimination of MTCT by the end of 2020 included testing of 95% of pregnant women for HIV during ANC, ARV treatment of 95% of HIV-positive pregnant women to reduce the risk of transmission, HIV testing in 10% of male partners, complete HIV testing in 60% of women of childbearing age using family planning services, HIV testing in the first six weeks of 95% of children born to HIV-positive mothers, and ARV prophylaxis for 95% of children born to HIV-positive mothers [17]. Internationally, the UNAIDS and its partners set the ‘90–90–90 targets’ which aimed at testing 90% of all people living with HIV, treating 90% of those infected, and achieving viral suppression in 90% of those on treatment by 2020 [20, 21].\n\nAs Burkina Faso is in the process of eliminating MTCT of HIV, an estimation of the coverage of PMTCT services is vital to monitoring the progress related to both national and international targets, and to secure donor funding for PMTCT programs [22, 23]. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to assess trends in the uptake of PMTCT services from 2013 to 2020 in order to identify the roadblocks to achieving the national and international targets set for 2020. The findings could help improve interventions to reach the 2030 objective of elimination of HIV in Burkina Faso.\n\nMethods\n\nData source\n\nThis was a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of aggregated health facility data from the National Data Warehouse of the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health (ENDOS-BF), a district health information software version 2 (DHIS2) web platform which has been operational since 2013. The National Ethics Committee “Comité d’Ethique pour la Recherche en Santé (CERS)” of Burkina Faso (n°2021-06-157) approved the study protocol. Given that the analysis was performed at the population level without reference to information that would allow the identification of participants, the requirement for individual informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee. The study was conducted with the CERS authorization and all methods were carried out in accordance with its requirements.\n\nIn 2019, due to a prolonged strike by healthcare personnel including the retention of health data, some data were not available for use in this study. The indicators on the use of PMTCT services and their calculations are presented in Table 1.Table 1 Description of the indicators used to assess the uptake of PMTCT services in Burkina Faso from 2013 to 2020\n\nIndicators\tNumerator\tDenominator\t\nPregnant women\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were tested for HIV and received their results\tNumber of pregnant women who were tested for HIV and received their results\tNumber of new ANC\t\nProportion of pregnant women tested positive for HIV during ANC \tNumber of pregnant women who tested positive for HIV during ANC\tNumber of pregnant women who tested for HIV and received their results\t\nOverall proportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive during ANC\t(Number of pregnant women who tested positive for HIV during ANC) + (number of pregnant women already known to be HIV positive)\tNumber of new ANC\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive delivering in the health facility\tNumber of pregnant women who were HIV positive delivering in the health facility\tNumber of pregnant women who tested positive for HIV\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive and benefitted from post-partum family planning\tNumber of pregnant women who were HIV positive and benefitted from post-partum family planning\tNumber of pregnant women who were HIV positive delivering in the health facility\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive and receiving ART\tNumber of pregnant women who were HIV positive and receiving ART\tNumber of pregnant women who tested positive for HIV\t\nPartners of pregnant women\t\nProportion of partners of pregnant women who were tested for HIV\tNumber of partners of pregnant women who were tested for HIV\tNumber of new ANC\t\nProportion of partners of pregnant women who were tested HIV-positive\tNumber of partners of pregnant women who tested HIV-positive\tNumber of new ANC\t\nProportion of women of childbearing age using family planning services who completed the voluntary HIV test\tNumber of women of childbearing age using family planning services who completed the voluntary HIV test\tNumber of women of childbearing age using family planning services\t\nInfants born to HIV-positive mothers\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers receiving full ARV prophylaxis\tNumber of infants born to HIV-positive mothers receiving full ARV prophylaxis\tNumber of infants born alive to HIV-positive mothers\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis\tNumber of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis\tNumber of infants born alive to HIV-positive mothers\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened at 2 months of life or later with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technic\tNumber of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened at 2 months of life or later with PCR technic \tNumber of infants born alive to HIV-positive mothers\t\nProportion of infants who were tested HIV-positive via PCR technic\tNumber who tested HIV-positive via PCR technic\t(Number of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened at 2 months of life with PCR technic) + (Number of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened after 2 months of life with PCR technic)\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened with rapid tests at 18 months of life\tNumber of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened with rapid tests at 18 months of life\tNumber of infants born alive to HIV-positive mothers\t\nProportion of infants who were tested HIV-positive with a rapid diagnostic test at 18 months of life\tNumber of infants tested HIV-positive with a rapid diagnostic test at 18 months of life\tNumber of infants who received rapid diagnostic test at 18 months of life\t\n\nFor early infant diagnosis, the PCR test was performed at 2 months of age. When this test was not performed at 2 months, it was carried out at a later date, and whether or not the result was positive, a rapid serological test was planned at 18 months post-partum (end of the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV). The data obtained for this indicator were only related to screening and did not consider the receipt of the results. Data concerning PCR testing after 2 months were not available for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n\nSetting\n\nBurkina Faso is a landlocked Sahelian country with a surface area of 272,967 km2 (Institut Géographique du Burkina IGB, 2002) and is bordered by six countries in the West African sub-region (Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire) [24]. It is divided into 13 administrative regions and has 45 provinces [25].\n\nIn 2020, Burkina Faso had 06 university teaching hospitals, 09 regional hospitals, 46 medical centres with surgical facilities, 71 medical centres, 2041 health and social promotion centres, 111 isolated dispensaries, 09 isolated maternities and 641 private health facilities (hospital and non-hospital) [26]. Based on the activity report on the AIDS response in Burkina Faso in 2019, a total of 100 [public (75), private (9), faith-based (6), and community (10)] sites provided healthcare support (ART medical management) to persons living with HIV throughout the 13 regions of the country [27]. In addition to the coverage of all health districts, 1820 out of 1853 health facilities provided PMTCT services (coverage rate of 98.2%) [24]. Despite this high coverage, the enrolment rate of pregnant women for PMTCT services was 86.1%, which was still below the national target of 90% [24].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nEach indicator was computed as a proportion, and comparison was made between the different years using a chi-squared test for trends. Regions were not compared with each other. The significance threshold was set to 5% and all analysis was done with STATA version 16 software.\n\nResults\n\nThe proportion of pregnant women who were tested and received their results significantly increased from 47.9% in 2013 to 92.2% in 2018, and then decreased to 84.6% in 2020 (p value  < 0.001, Table 2). Only one region (Centre-Nord) met the national target of 95% of women who were tested for HIV and received their results (Fig. 2a), and six regions (Boucle du Mouhoun, Centre, Centre-Nord, Centre-Ouest, Centre-Sud, Nord) met at least the international target of 90%.Table 2 Trend of the PMTCT cascade indicators between 2013 and 2020 in Burkina Faso\n\nIndicators\t2013\t2014\t2015\t2016\t2017\t2018\t2019\t2020\tp value\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were tested for HIV and received their results (%)\t47.9\t83.4\t85.3\t84.9\t84.0\t92.2\t88.1\t84.6\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of pregnant women tested positive for HIV during antenatal care (ANC) (%)\t1.7\t0.9\t0.8\t0.7\t0.7\t0.6\t0.6\t0.5\t < 0.001**\t\nOverall proportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive during ANC (%)\t8.1\t3.6\t2.0\t1.5\t1.4\t1.3\t1.5\t1.1\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive delivering in the health facility (%)\t39.3\t53.5\t51.8\t45.4\t51.3\t49.4\tNA\t62.7\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive and benefitted from post-partum family planning (%)\tNA\tNA\tNA\t63.3\t89.0\t52.1\tNA\tNA\t0.029*\t\nProportion of partners of pregnant women who were tested for HIV (%)\t0.9\t1.2\t1.8\t2.5\t2.8\t3.2\tNA\t4.5\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of partners of pregnant women who were tested HIV positive (%)\t0.1\t0.3\t0.6\t0.4\t0.6\t0.4\tNA\t0.5\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of women of childbearing age using family planning services who completed the voluntary HIV test (%)\t10.6\t6.5\t10.8\t13.4\t11.7\t11.6\tNA\t17.2\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of pregnant women who were HIV positive and receiving ART (%)\tNA\tNA\tNA\t90.8\t100\t96.3\t100\t100\t < 0.01*\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers receiving full ARV prophylaxis (%)\t64.3\t70.4\t73.1\t94.4\t93.4\t93.4\t86.8\t86.8\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (%)\t50.9\t53.3\t66.9\t78.0\t73.4\t82.6\tNA\t74.4\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened at 2 months of life or later with PCR technic (%)\t7.4\t39.3\t48.5\t55.0\t59.4\t57.9\t63.6\t75.7\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of infants who were tested HIV-positive via PCR technic (%)\t22.8\t10.0\t7.9\t8.1\t5.3\t3.2\tNA\t3.8\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers who were screened with rapid tests at 18 months (%)\t21.0\t25.5\t28.7\t22.9\t25.1\t25.3\t32.1\t26.9\t < 0.001**\t\nProportion of infants who were tested HIV-positive with a rapid diagnostic test at 18 months of life (%)\t12.9\t14.7\t8.4\t31.6\t8.5\t6.8\t9.1\t9.3\t < 0.001**\t\nNA not available\n\n*Means significant p value (< 0.05); **means a very significant p value (< 0.001)\n\nFig. 2 Proportions of the main indicators of PMTCT in Burkina Faso in 2020. The proportion of pregnant women who tested for HIV during ANC and who received their results (a); the proportion of infants on ARV prophylaxis (b); and the proportion of exposed infants tested HIV-positive with PCR technic (c) is indicated\n\nAmongst the pregnant women who were tested for HIV, about 2 women in 100 were tested HIV-positive in 2013, compared to 5 in 1000 in 2020 (p value  < 0.001). The annual incidence was under 2% in 2020, with the highest incidence occuring in the Centre region (1.0%) and lowest in the Est region (0.1%).\n\nThe proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women who received ART also increased from 90.8% in 2016 to 100% in 2020. Likewise, the proportion of infants born to HIV-positive mothers receiving full ARV prophylaxis increased from 64.3% in 2013 to 86.8% in 2020.\n\nScreening at 2 months or later with PCR technic in infants significantly increased from 7.4% in 2013 to 75.7% in 2020 (p value <0.001). At the regional level, the rate of infants receiving full ARV prophylaxis was at least 95% in 3 regions (Centre-Sud, Est, and Nord) in 2020 (Fig. 2b).\n\nAmongst infants screened with PCR technic, the proportion of those who were tested HIV-positive decreased from 22.8% in 2013 to 3.8% in 2020. The lowest prevalence in 2020 was observed in the Centre-Est and Sahel regions, where no child were tested HIV-positive using PCR technic. In addition to these two regions, less than 2% of the exposed infants in 3 other regions (Boucle du Mouhoun, Centre-Ouest, and Nord) were tested HIV-positive in 2020 using PCR technic (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, in 2020, a high rate of HIV-positive exposed infants was observed in the Est and Plateau-Central regions via PCR technic (7.5% and 9.8%, respectively) and via rapid diagnostic testing at 18 months (71.4% and 13.3%, respectively).\n\nRegarding the partners of the pregnant women, the proportion of those who were tested for HIV increased from 0.9% in 2013 to 4.5% in 2020, with a prevalence of HIV of 0.5% in 2020. Centre-Nord was the only region to meet the national target (10%) of the proportion of partners tested for HIV in 2020 (15.9%).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study aimed to assess trends in the uptake of PMTCT services in Burkina Faso from 2013 to 2020. Our findings show that the proportion of pregnant women tested for HIV during ANC and who received their results, and HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART, significantly increased over the years. Positive trends were also observed for exposed infants who received ARV prophylaxis; those who performed a PCR screening at 2 months or later; and the proportion of partners of the pregnant women who were tested positive for HIV. National targets for HIV testing in pregnant women were achieved in just 1 region whereas 6 regions met the required international targets for testing and treatment.\n\nOur study suggests that Burkina Faso has made significant improvements in the uptake of PMTCT services from 2013 to 2020. Despite this progress, gaps remain in the uptake of PMTCT services amongst pregnant women and infants in relation to the national and international targets that were not achieved for most indicators, except for the proportion of pregnant women receiving ART in 2020.\n\nImplementing a strategy to reduce vertical HIV transmission involves two steps: testing women infected with HIV and accessing coordinated care for women and their children [28]. In terms of screening, the proportion of pregnant women who were tested and received their results during ANC increased by more than 50% from 2013 to 2020, showing that pregnant women have strongly adhered to PMTCT screening services in Burkina Faso. These results are consistent with findings from a similar study in Nigeria, which showed an increase from 50.1% in 2013 to 70.5% in 2017 [29]. This positive trend could be explained by the introduction of free HIV testing and ART in 2010 and the integration of HIV testing into reproductive health care in 2013 [30] associated with adequate counselling [31] given during ANC and sensitisation by community-based health workers through home visits [32–34].\n\nHowever, the rate slightly decreased in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The decrease in 2019 could be explained partly by the repeated strikes conducted by healthcare workers that year that lasted 8 months and were mainly motivated by wages increases, notably the application of the law on hospital services [35]. It could also be explained by the political instability the country has been facing and that worsened in 2019 with violent attacks that resulted in the closure or minimal operation of more than 200 health centres, limiting access to health services for around 1.2 million of persons [36]. A plethora of studies have revealed that political instability negatively impact maternal healthcare services utilization [37–39], and in the particular context of Burkina Faso, it has been shown that the worsening security situation led to a reduction in ANC visits by 1.8% [40]. Another reason for the decline in the proportion of pregnant women tested for HIV in 2020 was due to the disruptive effects of the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic on the healthcare system which may have impacted ANC and healthcare facility attendance due to the fear of contracting the virus. Results from several studies conducted in Africa revealed a decline in the uptake of healthcare services by pregnant women and infants after the pandemic began [41–43].\n\nTo better understand the impact on the uptake of PMTCT services and to identify innovative approaches to improve both the provision and utilisation of healthcare in this epidemiological context, both qualitative and quantitative studies are needed so that adapted measures based on the results can be quickly applied, avoiding a breakdown of the efforts made thus far to eliminate the MTCT of HIV in Burkina Faso. In addition, strengthening current strategies is necessary to bring this indicator up to the national target and maintaining it at this level. In 2020, only one region met the national target of 95% of the proportion of pregnant women tested for HIV and who received their results by the year 2020 [17]. The global UNAIDS and WHO targets of 90% were not achieved in 2020 (current proportion of 84.6%) showing a low uptake of this service. Strong efforts are thus required in low-performing regions to improve the rate of this indicator to achieve both national and international targets.\n\nAmongst the pregnant women who received ANC between 2013 and 2020, the prevalence of HIV decreased from 8.1% in 2013 to 1.1% in 2020, with a cumulative incidence ranging from 1.7% in 2013 to 0.5% in 2020. This decrease could be explained by the establishment of voluntary counselling and testing services for HIV among pregnant women in Burkina Faso [44]. In 2015, Burkina Faso adopted the option B+, which entails lifetime combined ART in pregnant women and ARV prophylaxis in new-borns [19].\n\nThe ART uptake of pregnant women significantly increased from 90.8% in 2016 to 100% in 2020 whilst ARV prophylaxis in exposed infants also increased from 64.3% in 2013 to 94.4% in 2016 but later decreased to 86.8% in 2020. The national target of 95% [17] was nearly achieved in 2016, and a decline was observed in 2019 and 2020 which was lower than the international targets of 90%. This trend could be explained by the reduction in the proportion of women who were tested and received their results, as well as the fact that the WHO option B+ focuses heavily on maternal ART, whereas infant pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was a lower priority. By testing more women, most of them would know their HIV status, and more exposed infants would also benefit from ARV prophylaxis.\n\nThe proportion of pregnant women who tested for HIV and received their results globally increased between 2013 and 2020 but a slight decrease was observed between 2015 and 2017. This decrease could be explained by factors such as: the change of strategy (the transition from option B to option B+ in 2015) which could have impacted the provision of services by the healthcare facilities and the demotivation of healthcare workers due to long delay in the payment of Performance-based financing (PBF) bonuses for the achievement of quantitative objectives [45]. Studies done in Burkina Faso showed great acceptability in the testing uptake by pregnant women but low rates in the reception of testing results [46].\n\nRegarding regional disparities, only 3 regions (Centre-Sud, Est, and Nord) met the national target of 95% for this indicator, suggesting that the policy in place did not work well in the other regions and that targeted interventions should be taken to improve and reach national targets related to reducing MTCT. Concerning the exposed infants, a significant increase was globally observed from 2013 to 2020 but however decreased in 2019, may be due to the health crisis caused by the political instability the country has been facing; which could have acted successively on demand (services no longer being frequented by mothers and children because of the absence of health workers in certain treatment sites….), and the provision of services (access to basic services such as testing services, delivery of results, care of mothers born with HIV,..).\n\nOur results also showed an increase in the proportion of exposed infants tested at 2 months or later with PCR technic, up to 75.7% in 2020. However, despite this increase, the result is still far from the international and national targets of 90% and 95%, respectively. PCR screening is an important factor for the early determination of children’s status and allows healthcare providers to offer optimal care in the management of HIV, assist in decision making regarding infant feeding, and avoid needless stress for mothers and families, helping them increase the efficacy and coverage of PMTCT interventions [47]. Similar studies conducted in SSA have also observed this trend of a low rate of achievement of PCR testing [48, 49]. This poses a real problem with the ARV start-up protocol in HIV-infected infants and may be the basis for the increase in mortality due to HIV [50]. At 18 months of age, we observed a relatively low rate of less than 50% among exposed infants from 2013 to 2020. Although 75.7% of the exposed infants underwent PCR testing at 2 months or later in 2020, only 26.9% did a rapid diagnostic test at 18 months, showing a low uptake of services for HIV-exposed infants, and indicating that there is a gap in the use of the PMTCT cascade, which constitutes a barrier to the success of the program. According to the WHO’s recommendation, after ‘the early infant diagnosis’ at 6 weeks, another HIV test should be carried out at 18 months to provide the final infant diagnosis with infant infections that are being transmitted during breastfeeding [51]. HIV-positive infants and children who start treatment late are more likely to experience treatment failure, thus, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and emphasizing the importance of the final testing at 18 months, which marks the end of exposure to postnatal transmission of HIV[51].\n\nWe also observed that most pregnant and postpartum women are not completely removed from the cascade despite most of the results showing a suboptimal uptake of services in the cascade. For example, in 2020, 84.6% of pregnant women were tested for HIV and received their results. Among those who tested HIV positive, 100% of them received ART, and 86.6% and 74.4% of their infants were administered full ARV and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis respectively. Almost 75.7% of these infants were screened at 2 months or later with PCR technic, but only 26.9% of them received final testing at 18 months. Our results are consistent with those of several other studies [52, 53] but show that efforts are still needed; first, to improve the uptake of PMTCT services and secondly, to concentrate more on the postpartum period to ensure a continuum of care.\n\nAnother factor that could affect the success of the PMTCT program is partner testing. According to an activity report on the AIDS response in Burkina Faso, partner screening is an indicator of the involvement of men in reproductive health, particularly regarding PMTCT [24]. However, our study revealed that only 4.5% of partners were screened in 2020, whereas the national target was 10%. Only one region met this target, indicating a strong disparity between regions as well as the low engagement of partners in PMTCT services, which could have negatively impacted the follow-up of the mother/child pair [54].\n\nOur results should be interpreted with caution. Data included in the analyses were aggregated and as a result, information bias could have occurred while collecting or compiling data in each healthcare facility, as well as missing data among some relevant indicators. However, these aggregated data are sufficiently powerful to give reliable information. Since these data do not include individual or longitudinal information on women, partners, or mother-baby pairs through the cascade of PMTCT events, the rate of women and children retained in care (which is an important measure for the assessment of the PMTCT program) could not be determined. Although our study sort to assess the uptake of different services constituting the cascade of PMTCT, these variables were not available in our analysis. Therefore, further research involving the triangulation of data could include this aspect to get a deeper and more comprehensive information on the uptake of PMTCT services in Burkina Faso. It should also be noted that many indicators were not collected in 2019 which did not allow us to better appreciate the tendency for those indicators.\n\nRegardless of these limitations, our results suggest that strong monitoring efforts must be made to maintain a high number of HIV-positive women undergoing ART and to improve the screening of infants born to HIV-positive mothers at 2 and 18 months to achieve the goal of eliminating the vertical transmission of HIV in Burkina Faso. The screening of partners and ARV prophylaxis of infants born to HIV-positive mothers are indicators that should also be improved.\n\nConclusion\n\nPMTCT indicators improved over time in Burkina Faso; however, strong disparities remain between regions. Despite these improvements in PMTCT services, only 1 indicator related to HIV-positive pregnant women receiving ART met the national and international targets set for 2020. In the era of the next UNAIDS 95-95-95 target, and the context of low coverage of PMTCT indicators in some regions, strategies to address these disparities are needed to achieve the targets set for 2030 in Burkina Faso.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n\nANC Antenatal care\n\nART Antiretroviral therapy\n\nARV Anti-retroviral\n\nCD4 Cluster of differentiation 4\n\nCERS National Ethics Committee of Burkina Faso\n\nDHIS2 District health information software version 2\n\nENDOS-BF National Data Warehouse of the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health\n\nMTCT Mother-to-child transmission\n\nPCR Polymerase chain reaction\n\nPMTCT Prevention of mother-to-child transmission\n\nPrEP Pre-exposure prophylaxis\n\nSSA Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nUNAIDS United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\n\nVIH Human immunodeficiency virus\n\nWHO World Health Organization\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to the Health Ministry for data collection particularly Moussa DADJOARI, Tinga Fulbert ILBOUDO and Laurent HEMA.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nLCF, and JO managed and analyzed data, implemented the methodology, interpreted results and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

Prompt implementation of effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission(PMTCT) of HIV programs helped prevent more than 800,000 children from becoming newly infected between 2005 and the end of 2012[3].Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rates in the developed regions have decreased to 1% or less due to widespread scale up of PMTCT of HIV programs[4]. The first case of an infant infected with HIV by vertical transmission in China was reported in 1995; afterwards, the MTCT rate rapidly increased to 0.4% in 2002. The Chinese ministry of health launched a PMTCT program in China in 2003 [5]. In 2004, the Chinese ministry of health issued a guideline on PMCTC that included HIV counseling and testing services, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), elective cesarean section, and avoiding breastfeeding[6]. It is estimated that more than 780,000 people were living with HIV at the end of 2011 in China; 28.6% were women and 1.1% were children infected through MTCT[7].\n\nOver the past 10 years, substantial progress has been made in the implementation of PMTCT interventions in China. PMTCT strategic vision 2010–2015, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized tracking program performance and its impact on the MTCT rates and on maternal and child health[8]. However, studies that were conducted to track the progress of the programs were insufficient, and a systematic review on the uptake of these programs has not been performed in China.\n\nOnly descriptive epidemiological studies that provide data regarding PMTCT interventions programs were eligible for this study. The goal of this systematic review is to provide an overview and pooled prevalence estimate of HIV-positive among pregnant women and exposed infants in China. We also provide an overview and pooled uptake estimate of some important PMTCT interventions programs including voluntary HIV counseling and testing, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis in pregnant women and infants, HIV-diagnosis of the exposed infants, termination of pregnancy, elective cesarean section and artificial feeding in China. In addition, we also provide a simple analysis of several trends and distributions available from the data in order to provide more insight into better treatment and control of MTCT of HIV in China.\n\nMethods\nSearch Strategy and Selection Criteria\nWe searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang (Chinese) to identify research studies that described the uptake of PMTCT programs in China.Details on search terms can be found in the S1 Appendix. The same search strategies were used with each database.We placed no language restrictions on the searches or search results. Additional strategies included hand searches of journals that were not indexed in the electronic sources, web-based searches, and screening of reference lists of retrieved studies for additional potentially relevant articles.\n\nOnly descriptive epidemiological studies were eligible for this study. When a study reported the results from different subpopulations, we treated them independently. We excluded meetings, literature reviews, discussions, editorials, research overviews, book reviews, letters, and news articles. We excluded qualitative studies, modeling studies, studies where uptake of PMTCT was assessed by interview, and cost-effectiveness studies. We excluded studies that did not provide useable data. Studies with fewer than 30 participants were excluded to improve the efficiency of the analysis.\n\nTwo of the authors (MJ and HZ)independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies. Studies that appeared to be relevant were selected, and the same two reviewers (MJ and HZ)independently assessed the full-text versions. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or the involvement of a third reviewer(ZH). Fig 1 shows the flowchart for selecting articles[9–65].\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.g001Fig 1 Prisma 2009 Flow diagram literature search and study selection.\nPRISMA diagram showing the different steps of systematic review, starting from literature search to study selection and exclusion. At each step, the reasons for exclusion are indicated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052562.g001).\n\nData Collection\nWe developed and modified a data abstraction form after a training exercise for investigators. We extracted the following data from the eligible studies: characteristics of the studies (years, design, ART regimen, and regions), participants (age, sex, and the status of HIV infection), and primary and second outcomes. We also gathered data on potential explanatory variables (i.e., variables that might explain the variance in uptake of PMTCT; Table 1). We also obtained data from the website of the Chinese administrative region; these data were used to categorize regions into regions (EasternChina, south-central China, northChina, northwestChina, southwestern China, northeastChina, and special district of Taiwan, Hongkong, and Macao) and gross domestic product in $US per head in 2013 (low income (<5520), low-middle income (5635–6750), high-middle income (6892–9961), and high income (>10915))[66,67].\n\nFor each study, one reviewer(ZD) extracted the data, a second reviewer (SZ)checked the accuracy, and a third reviewer (JH)evaluated the data for disagreements.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.t001Table 1 Characteristics of Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis.\nStudy, year\tProvince\tRegion\tIncome level$\n\tStudy

voluntary HIV-testing; (4) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART); (5) selecting termination of pregnancy; (6) elective cesarean section; and (7) artificialfeeding. The primary outcomes for children were the following: (8) HIV-positive rate (9) HIV diagnosis of the exposed infants between 12 and 18 months by PCR or antibody test; and (10) initiating ARP in exposed infants.\n\n& Quality score assessed by Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)\n\n$ Income level is divided to high income (>10915), high-middle income (6892–9961), low-middle income, low income (<5520) according to GDP (in $US per head)\n\nPrimary Outcomes\nThe primary outcomes for pregnant women were the following: (1) HIV-positive ratein the present pregnancy (including antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum); (2) underwent voluntary HIV-counselingin the present pregnancy (including antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum); (3) underwent voluntary HIV-testingin the present pregnancy (including antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum); (4) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 28 weeks of pregnancy (5) selecting termination of pregnancy; (6) elective cesarean section; and (7) artificialfeeding. The primary outcomes for children were the following: (8) HIV-positive rate (9) HIV diagnosis of the exposed infants between 12 and 18 months by PCR or antibody test; and (10) initiating ARP in exposed infantsin the first 72 hours after delivery.\n\nQuality assessment\nThe quality of eligible literature was assessed according to the criteria of observational studies in recommended by Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ included 11-items with a yes/no/unclear response option: the “Yes” would be scored “1”, “No” or “unclear” was scored “0”. Articles were scored as follows: low quality (0–3), moderate quality (4–7), high quality (8–11) [68].\n\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated the pooled rate or percentage with 95% CIs with a random effect model (DerSimonian–Laird’s method)[69]. We used the Q-statistic and I2 statistic to estimate the heterogeneity between studies, and we used “small,” “moderate” and “large” to describe values of 25%, 50% and 75% for the I2[70–71].\n\nWe investigated potential sources of heterogeneity with subgroup analyses. In subgroup analyses, we estimated the uptake of PMTCT according to regions (EasternChina, southChina, South-central China, northChina, northwest China, southwestern China, northeastChina, and special district of Taiwan Hongkong and Macao), per capita GDP (low income, low-middle income, high-middle income, and high income), pregnancy stage (premarital checkups, antenatal care, and at delivery), and antiretroviral therapy regimens (single regimen vs. combination regimens).\n\nTo establish the robustness of the outcome by sensitivity analyses, we applied a fixed effects model;used the trim-and-fill method; and excluded studies with a low number of participants [72].A funnel plot was used to explore the publication bias. Funnel-plot asymmetry was further assessed by the method of Begg’ test and the modified Egger’s linear regression test[73].We performed all analyses using the software STATA (version 11.0).\n\nResults\nCharacteristics of Eligible Studies\nWe identified 4459papers from a database search, 28 papers through internet and hand searches, and 15 papers through checking reference lists. No unpublished data that met our inclusion criteria were identified. During the step of screening the abstracts, 2884 papers were excluded, leaving 639full text papers that were assessed for eligibility. We excluded 40 papers with fewer than 30 participants; in the end, a total of 57 papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (Fig 1). These 57 studies originated from 31 of 34 provinces in China. Table 1 presents the characteristics of every analysis outcome, 13 studies were of high quality, and other studies were of moderate quality.\n\nEstimated HIV-positive rate\nThirty-four studies, including 15,994,415 pregnant women, reported the HIV-positive rate of pregnant women (Fig 2). We estimated that the mean HIV-positive rate of pregnant women was 0.11% (95% CI = 0.1–0.12) with a high level of heterogeneity between the rate estimates (Q = 5049.43, P<0.001; I2 = 99.30%). Sixteen studies, including 1,480 infants, reported the HIV-positive rate of exposed infants. We estimated that the mean HIV-positive rate of exposed infants was 4.4% (95% CI = 3.2–5.5) with a low level of heterogeneity between the rate estimates (Q = 13.96, P = 0.602; I2 = 7.10%) (Fig 2 and Table 2).\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.g002Fig 2 Meta-Analyses of Uptake of Prevention of Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) in China.\nART = antiretroviral therapy; ARP = antiretroviral prophylaxis; ES refer to rate /percentage.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.t002Table 2 Egger’s linear regression test and Begg's test to measure the funnel plot asymmetric.\nOutcome\tHeterogeneity\tEgg's test\t\tBegg's test\t\nQ\tp\tI2(%)\tt\tP\tz\tp\t\nEstimated HIV-positive rate of pregnant women\t5049.93\t<0.001\t99.3\t6.63\t0\t2.98\t0.003\t\nEstimated HIV-positive rate of exposed infants\t13.96\t0.602\t7.1\t1.77\t0.077\t2.05\t0.058\t\nPercentage of voluntary HIV-counseling\t320000\t<0.001\t100\t-0.5\t0.628\t0.09\t0.929\t\nPercentage of voluntary HIV-testing\t160000\t<0.001\t100\t-1.25\t0.222\t-1.61\t0.108\t\nPercentage of initiating ART in HIV-positive women\t1335.82\t<0.001\t97.1\t-0.7\t0.486\t-2.25\t0.025\t\nPercentage of initiating ARP in exposed infants\t617.39\t<0.001\t95.1\t-2.58\t0.031\t-3\t0.003\t\nPercentage of HIV diagnosis of the exposed infants\t970.78\t<0.001\t98.5\t-1.67\t0.096\t-0.62\t0.545\t\nPercentage of selecting termination of pregnancy\t12909.6\t<0.001\t96.9\t1.68\t0.101\t0.94\t0.346\t\nPercentage of cesarean section\t1370.5\t<0.001\t98.9\t0.16\t0.874\t0.81\t0.418\t\nPercentage of artificial feeding\t1255.5\t<0.001\t100\t-0.94\t0.358\t-2.98\t0.003\t\nEstimated Uptake of PMTCT Programs Services\nThe estimated percentages of voluntary HIV-counseling and HIV-testing of pregnant women were 79.3% (95% CI = 75.4–83.3) and 81.2% (95% CI = 77.8–84.6), respectively. The studies were very heterogeneous in both of the analyses (Fig 2). We identified 35 studies providing data for the percentage of initiating ART in HIV-positive women and 32 studies providing data for the percentage of initiating ARP in exposed infants. We estimated that the percentage of initiating ART in HIV-positive women was 71.0% (95% CI = 66.3–75.8) and initiating ARP in exposed infants was 78.3% (95% CI = 74.9–81.8); these estimates were also associated with a high level of heterogeneity (Fig 2).Other outcomes were also estimated, and the results are displayed in Fig 2.\n\nSubgroup Analyses of the Uptake of PMTCT Programs\n\nTable 3 and Table 4 present the variation in the uptake of PMTCT programs according to years. No study on PMTCT programs in China was reported in China before 2004. The time trends for the HIV-positive rate of pregnant were reported in 34 studies from 2000–2012; the mean estimated rate was not significantly changed since 2000. However, time trends for the HIV-positive rate of exposed infants were estimated for only 3 low income regions from 2005–2012; the mean estimated rate in these regions for 2005 was 11.8% (95% CI = 0–27.1) compared with 6.1% (95% CI = 2.7–9.4)in 2010. The estimated percentages of initiating ART in HIV-positive women and initiating ARP in exposed infants were continually increased, and the mean estimated percentage of initiating ART in HIV-positive women increased from 64.6% (95% CI = 60.7–68.6)in 2005 to 79.5% (95% CI = 76.0–83.1)in 2012, while initiating ARP in exposed infants increased from 77.2%(95% CI = 73.6–80.7)in 2005 to 91.6%(95% CI = 87.5–95.6) in 2010. The estimated percentage of voluntary HIV-testing and HIV diagnosis of the exposed infants has continually increased to 100% since 2004, while voluntary HIV-counseling has not obviously changed. Interestingly, the estimated percentage of selecting termination of pregnancy decreased from 40% (95% CI = 9.6–70.4)in 2003 to 15.8%(95% CI = 0–32.2)in 2011; the estimated percentage of artificial feeding was not obviously changed.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.t003Table 3 Subgroup Analyses of Uptake of Prevention of Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) from 2004 to 2007.\nOutcomes\tBefore 2004\t2004\t2005\t2006\t2007\t\nStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\t\nHIV-positive rate of pregnant women (%)\n\t12\t0.1(0.00–0.1)\t8\t0.10(0.06–0.14)\t13\t0.01(0.01–0.02)\t15\t0.11(0.09–0.14)\t14\t0.12(0.10–0.14)\t\nHIV-positive rate of exposed infants\t-\t-\t-\t-\t1\t0.12(0–0.27)\t3\t0.08(0–0.17)\t3\t0.13(0.05–0.22)\t\nVoluntary HIV-counseling\t-\t-\t1\t0.81(0.79–0.82)\t2\t0.81(0.59–1.00)\t2\t0.9(0.79–1.00)\t2\t0.88(0.82–0.93)\t\nVoluntary HIV-testing\t-\t-\t5\t0.58(0.21–0.95)\t8\t0.63(0.48–0.78)\t9\t0.72(0.65–0.79)\t9\t0.81(0.76–0.85)\t\nInitiating ART in HIV-positive women\t-\t-\t-\t-\t1\t0.65(0.61–0.69)\t1\t0.67(0.64–0.70)\t1\t0.67(0.64–0.69)\t\nInitiating ARP in exposed infants\t-\t-\t-\t-\t1\t0.77(0.74–0.81)\t1\t0.80(0.78–0.83)\t1\t0.84(0.82–0.86)\t\nHIV diagnosis of the exposed infants\t-\t-\t-\t-\t1\t0.81(0.64–0.98)\t3\t0.86(0.82–0.89)\t3\t0.76(0.73–0.79)\t\nSelecting termination of pregnancy\t2\t0.4(0.10–0.70)\t3\t0.25(0.07–0.43)\t8\t0.28(0.22–0.34)\t7\t0.37(0.30–0.45)\t6\t0.36(0.27–0.44)\t\nCesarean section\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t\nArtificial feeding\t-\t-\t-\t-\t2\t0.87(0.85–0.90)\t2\t0.82(0.58–1.00)\t2\t0.92(0.90–0.93)\t\nNote: ARP = antiretroviral prophylaxis; ART = antiretroviral therapy\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.t004Table 4 Subgroup Analyses of Uptake of Prevention of Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) from 2008 to 2012.\nOutcomes\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t\nStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\t\nHIV-positive rate of pregnant women (%)\n\t14\t0.10(0.08–0.12)\t13\t0.07(0.01–0.12)\t13\t0.09(0.07–0.10)\t5\t0.10(0.06–0.14)\t3\t0.15(0.01 to 0.28)\t\nHIV-positive rate of exposed infants\t3\t0.06(0.01–0.10)\t2\t0.04(0.00–0.08)\t2\t0.04(0.00–0.08)\t2\t0.03(0.00–0.05)\t2\t0.06(0.03–0.09)\t\nVoluntary HIV-counseling\t3\t0.88(0.76–0.99)\t3\t0.80(0.76–0.84)\t2\t0.64(0.64–0.65)\t1\t0.83(0.83–0.84)\t-\t-\t\nVoluntary HIV-testing\t10\t0.76(0.71–0.82)\t8\t0.77(0.71–0.83)\t6\t0.81(0.68–0.93)\t4\t0.95(0.90–0.99)\t3\t0.99(0.97–1.00)\t\nInitiating ART in HIV-positive women\t1\t0.74(0.72–0.77)\t2\t0.71(0.52–0.90)\t4\t0.79(0.72–0.86)\t1\t0.75(0.64–0.86)\t1\t0.80(0.76–0.83)\t\nInitiating ARP in exposed infants\t2\t0.83(0.69–0.97)\t1\t0.83(0.81–0.84)\t2\t0.92(0.88–0.96)\t-\t-\t-\t-\t\nHIV diagnosis of the exposed infants\t3\t0.74(0.72–0.77)\t2\t0.73(0.70–0.76)\t1\t0.82(0.75–0.89)\t1\t0.99(0.98–1.00)\t1\t0.98(0.95–1.00)\t\nSelecting termination of pregnancy\t6\t0.31(0.22–0.41)\t4\t0.24(0.14–0.35)\t3\t0.19(0.09–0.28)\t1\t0.16(0–0.32)\t-\t-\t\nCesarean section\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t\nArtificial feeding\t3\t0.91(0.84–0.99)\t1\t0.94(0.93–0.95)\t1\t0.81(0.73–0.89)\t-\t-\t-\t-\t\nNote: ARP = antiretroviral prophylaxis; ART = antiretroviral therapy\n\nThe uptake of PMTCT programs varied widely between regions (Table 5). The region with the highest HIV-positive rate of pregnant women was the Xinjiang Uygur [Uighur] autonomous region (0.41%, 95% CI = 0.38–0.44) in northwest China, but only one study included that region in its estimate. The rates in eastern China (0.02%, 95% CI = 0.01–0.02) and south-central China (0.06%, 95% CI = 0.05–0.07) were all less than 0.1% (Table 4). At a provincial level, the estimated voluntary HIV-testing rate ranged from approximately 44.3% (95% CI = 20.4–68.2) in several northwest regions to 79.0%(95% CI = 75.3–82.4)in both south-central China and southwestern China (Table 4). Northwest China also reported the lowest percentage of voluntary HIV-counseling; the estimated mean rate was 19.8% (95% CI = 16.2%-23.5). The rates of initiating ART in HIV-positive women were the highest in northwest China (76.8%, 95% CI = 74.5–79.1), which was followed by south-central China (70.0%, 95% CI = 60.5–77.7); the lowest rates were for eastern China (49.3%, 95% CI = 19.5–79.1) (Table 5).\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135068.t005Table 5 Subgroup Analyses of Uptake of Prevention of Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) by Region.\nOutcomes\tEastern China\tSouth-central China\tNorthwest China\tSouthwestern China\t\nStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\tStudies\tRate(95%CI)\t\nHIV-positive rate of pregnant women(%)\t2\t0.02(0.01–0.02)\t16\t0.06(0.05–0.07)\t1\t0.41(0.39–0.44)\t14\t0.24(0.20–0.28)\t\nHIV-positive rate of exposed infants\t0\t-\t5\t0.04(0.02–0.05)\t1\t0.06(0.04–0.08)\t7\t0.04(0.02–0.07)\t\nVoluntary HIV-counseling\t3\t0.84(0.72–0.97)\t1\t0.73(0.73–0.74)\t1\t0.20(0.16–0.24)\t5\t0.77(0.72–0.82)\t\nVoluntary HIV-testing\t3\t0.72(0.51–0.93)\t7\t0.79(0.71–0.87)\t3\t0.44(0.20–0.68)\t11\t0.79(0.75–0.82)\t\nInitiating ART in HIV-positive women\t2\t0.49(0.20–0.79)\t13\t0.70(0.56–0.84)\t1\t0.77(0.75–0.79)\t13\t0.69(0.61–0.78)\t\nInitiating ARP in exposed infants\t2\t0.66(0.50–0.82)\t14\t0.78(0.68–0.87)\t1\t0.83(0.80–0.85)\t11\t0.75(0.66–0.84)\t\nHIV diagnosis of the exposed infants\t0\t-\t7\t0.67(0.53–0.81)\t1\t0.87(0.84–0.89)\t6\t0.69(0.38–1.00)\t\nSelecting termination of pregnancy\t1\t0.43(0.35–0.51)\t20\t0.41(0.32–0.50)\t0\t-\t12\t0.31(0.21–0.42)\t\nCesarean section\t0\t-\t6\t0.54(0.32–0.75)\t0\t-\t5\t0.45(0.10–0.79)\t\nArtificial feeding\t1\t-\t12\t0.91(0.87–0.94)\t0\t-\t8\t0.94(0.92–0.96)\t\nNote: ARP = antiretroviral prophylaxis; ART = antiretroviral therapy\n\nThe estimated HIV-positive rate of pregnant women was the highest in studies from low income regions(0.20%, 95%CI = 0.17–0.22), which was followed by low-middle income regions(0.15%, 95%CI = 0.07–0.29).

In univariate and multivariable meta-regression analyses (Table 6), we usedvariables including year of publication, sample size, regions (eastern China, south-central China, northwest China, southwestern China, and trans-regional), income level, and quality score. We notedthat regions, income level, and sample size were significantly associated with the estimated HIV-positive rate of pregnant women; year of publication was significantly associated with the percentage of voluntary HIV-testing (R2 = 25.35%, P = 0.004); year of publication (R2 = 30.63%, P = 0.056) and sample size (R2 = 38.68%, P = 0.032) were significantly associated with the percentage of voluntary HIV-counseling; income level were significantly associated with the percentage of initiating ARP in exposed infants (R2 = 12.36%, P = 0.043); year of publication was significantly associated with the percentage of selecting termination of pregnancy (R2 = 17.59%, P = 0.007). Furthermore, in multivariable analysis these variables still were significantly associated with the heterogeneity of these main outcomes (Table 6).\n\nEgger’slinear regression test (P = 0.093) and

the first comprehensive overview of PMTCT programs in China at the national level. We included 57 studies covering all provinces in China, and there was no report on PMTCT programs before 2004, which may be because the Chinese ministry of health first issued guidelines on PMCTC in 2004[6].Our review showed that the overall uptake of PMTCT programs was low and did not reach the 80% target that was setby the United Nations General Assembly Special Session(UNGASS)[74]. The estimated percentage of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive pregnant women was still unsatisfactory. We estimated that the MTCT rate in China was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.2–5.5), which was substantially higher than in the U.S. and Europe (less than 1%), while it was lower than some low- and middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (11%)[1,75]. Great successes in reducing the MTCT rate has been achieved in China (reduced from 11.8% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2009) due to the scale up of PMTCT programs since the Ministry of Health launched PMTCT programs in 2003. In 2001 UNGASS set a goal that would reduce theproportion of HIV infected infants by 50% in ten years, and in order to achieve this target they estimated that 80% of pregnant women andtheir children need to receive PMTCT programs service [74]. Despite efforts to increase the uptake of PMTCT interventions services, coverage is still lower than desired in China. Many international non-governmental organizations, such as the UN Secretary General, G8 countries, the Global Fund toFight AIDS, WHO and so on have committed to further develop and improve the quality and effectiveness ofPMTCT service coverage in low- and middle-income countries[75]. Integration of PMTCT with other healthcare services, such as maternal, newborn, and child health may be a crucialcomponent of the strategy to scale up PMTCT programs. In China, PMTCT services were integrated with antenatal care and perinatal care, pregnant women were provided with HIV testing and counseling and HIV positivepregnantwomen were provided with antiretroviral prophylaxis in antenatal care and attending labor ward.Discouragingly, a recent review noted very limited, non-generalizableevidence of improved PMTCT intervention uptake in integratedPMTCT programscompared to non- or partially integrated services[76].A reviewassessing the role of family planning in eliminating new pediatric HIV infectionsreported that integrating family planning and HIV services is an effective strategy for increasing access to contraception among women with HIV who do not wish to become pregnant, which could accelerate the ending of new pediatric HIV infections[77]. In recent years, PMTCT servicewas also integrated with family planning service in China; HIV testing was provided forwomen of childbearing age when attending national free pre-pregnancy eugenic health check project, and the HIV-positive women were suggested that they should receive antiretroviral therapy before pregnancy or prevent unintended pregnancies by the use of contraception. But the coverage of integrated family planning/HIV service was very low in China, which prompt the Chinese government to call for increaseddomestic and international financing to expand the uptake of PMTCT.\n\nWe noted significant heterogeneity within studies in this meta-analysis, and meta-regression analyses revealed that year of publication was the main factors that explained much of the heterogeneity between studies.PMTCT programs have changed significantly over the years, and there are guidelines for starting ART for both women and infants. While this is acknowledged, treating all studies from 2000 to 2014 as equivalent leads to very heterogeneous data. For example, if the risk of MTCT was high in 2000, when presumably no ART was administered, it is unfair to combine these data with recent guidelines to provide ART if CD4<500 or lifelong ART (Option B+). Therefore, we performed subgroup analysis by years and present the historical and current policies for PMTCT services.Study region and income level may also account for much of the heterogeneity between studies. For example, northwest China had the highest MTCT rate (5.9%)and lowest uptake of PMTCT programs services; the high income region usually reported the highest percentages of voluntary HIV-counseling (93.2%) and voluntary HIV-testing (94.9%).The variation between regions and income levels were consistent with the global uptake of HIV testing; the low income countries are reported to have low uptake of HIV testing, and the coverage for early infant diagnosis of HIV was below 6% in some low income countries (Angola, Nigeria, Malawi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Chad) in 2012[78,79].Such variation could be explained by lower government financial investment, limited health resources and inefficient programs implementation strategy in regions with low uptake of PMTCT services.Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) was effective in reducing MTCT as well as cost effective as a PMTCT intervention. The WHO had recommend that all children younger than 2 years old who are living with HIV should be treated, and the important first step was to identify the HIV-infected children through developing effective strategies for HIV testing. Although HIV testing facilities have increased over the past ten years, the uptake of VCT has still been low; UNAIDS reported in 2012 that 50% of individuals living with HIV were unaware of their HIV status[80]. Encouraging data are presented in this review, including that the estimated percentage of voluntary HIV-testing in pregnant women continually increased from 57.9% in 2004 to 98.5% in 2012 and that the estimated infant free HIV antibody testing rate over 18 months of age increased from 81% in 2005 to 97.7% in 2012. The number of new HIV-infected children in the 21 priority African countries in the UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) global plan decreased by 38% between 2009 and 2012 because of increased access to antiretroviral treatment to prevent MTCT[81,82]. We estimated that more than 70% of HIV-infected pregnant women never received antiretroviral treatmentin antenatal care in China, which is significant lower than that in low- and middle- income countries with only 55% (range 22–99%) of HIV positive women starting highly active antiretroviral therapy in antenatal care[75,83]. An encouraging result in this meta-analysis was that initiating ARP in exposed infants continually increased from 77.0% in 2005 to 98.1% in 2012, which achieved the goal of the 12thFive-Year action plan on containment, prevention and control of HIV/AIDS that the percentage of HIV exposed infants who received ARV would be more than 90% by the year 2015[84]. According to recently WHO report, the use of combination ART during pregnancy is preferable to single therapy[85]. The combination ART is more effective at PMTCT, and it has the advantages of reducing sexual HIV transmission and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality[86]. In China, we estimated that approximately 31.3% (95% CI, 15.5–47.0) of women with HIV received the combination of three antiretroviral drugs (AZT+3TC/AZT+NVP), and < 1% of exposed infants received the combination of three antiretroviral drugs.\n\nDespite the great successes in reducing MTCT in China, we are facing many challenges, such as low coverage of PMTCT programs, stigma and discrimination, drug resistance, and delayed infant HIV diagnosis[5]. This review had several limitations; firstly, significant heterogeneity between studies was observed. Although we performed subgroup analyses by publication year, geographical area, and income level, and these factors may be the sources of between-study heterogeneity. However other unmeasured characteristics in study population and limitations of the included studies likely influence the detected heterogeneity; unfortunately, we did not obtain enough information about these aspects for further analysis. Secondly, we have only conducted the search in electronic databases. Studies published in local journals which are not indexed in electronic databases might have been missed out in this review. The third, results from Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s test are different but the funnel plot and Trim and Fill methods suggested the presence of a potential publication bias, a language bias, and inflated estimates by a flawed methodological design in smaller studies.The last, some pooled estimates in subgroups should be interpreted with caution due the small number studies.\n\nIn conclusion, PMTCT programs have scaled up quickly in recent years in China. However, antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive pregnant, antiretroviral prevention and HIV diagnosis in exposed infants were still unsatisfactory. Moreover, there was a big gap of uptake of PMTCT programs between regions and income levels. These results highlight the need to further scale up PMTCT services, especially in regions with the lowest coverage, so that more women can access and utilize them.\n\nSupporting Information\nS1 PRISMA Checklist PRISMA-2009- checklist.\n(DOC)\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n S1 Appendix Search Terms of the Meta-analysis.\nSearch terms consisted of the following key wordsincludingPMTCT, HIV, and China were provided.\n\n(DOCX)\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n The authors would like to thank all for their valuable contributions to this article.\n==== Refs\nReferences\n1 \nShetty AK  (2013 ) Epidemiology of HIV infection in women and children: a global perspective .
