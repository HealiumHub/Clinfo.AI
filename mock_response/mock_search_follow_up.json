        "content": "The question \"Analyze further results in Zimbabwe?\" is addressed by examining the findings from the 2013-2014 Zimbabwe PMTCT Effectiveness Survey. The study assessed mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among adolescents, young women, and adult mothers in Zimbabwe. The survey included 1,171 HIV-infected mother-infant pairs and followed them until the infants were 18 months old. The results indicated that the 18-month cumulative MTCT risk was highest among adolescents (aged ≤19 years) at 12%, compared to 7.5% for young women (aged 20–24 years) and 6.9% for adult women (aged ≥25 years) (Burrage et al.).\n\nDespite similar coverage of antenatal care and HIV testing across age groups, adolescents had lower antiretroviral medication coverage during pregnancy (76.8%) compared to young women (83.8%) and adults (87.8%). Factors associated with no antiretroviral use during pregnancy included no antenatal care attendance, no HIV testing, and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy, but age itself was not a risk factor (Burrage et al.).\n\nThe study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the higher risk of MTCT in adolescents, despite the overall success of PMTCT programs in Zimbabwe. It suggests that additional research is needed to explore the causes of higher MTCT rates in adolescents and to develop tailored interventions to improve outcomes in this vulnerable group (Burrage et al.).\n\n",

Among HIV-positive mothers diagnosed prenatally, the adjusted odds ratio of no ARV use during pregnancy was increased among those who had no antenatal care attendance (adjusted odds ratio: 7.7 [3.7–16.0]), no HIV testing (7.3 [2.3–23.5]), no prepartum CD4 count testing (2.1 [1.3–3.4]), and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy (2.9 [1.8–4.8]). Age was not a risk factor.\n\nConclusions:\n\nWith similar coverage of prevention of MTCT services, the 18-month cumulative MTCT risk was higher among adolescents and young women, compared with adults. Additional research should examine the causes to develop targeted interventions.\n\nMother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT)\nAdolescents\nYoung women\nZimbabwe\n\npmcAlthough adolescent girls and young women (aged 15–24 years) were only 10% of the population, they accounted for 26% of new HIV infections in 2016 in eastern and southern Africa [1]. Given their high HIV incidence, HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding adolescents and young women are likely to be at high risk for mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) [2]. Sub-Saharan Africa has the world’s highest adolescent birth rates; approximately 25% of young women aged 20–24 years delivered a child before 18 years old between 1995 and 2011 [3]. Two studies from South Africa found adolescent mothers have significantly higher risk of early MTCT measured at 4–8 weeks postpartum compared with older mothers [2,4]. Prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) services during pregnancy, including the use of antiretroviral medications (ARV), have reduced MTCT significantly [5]. Although HIV-positive adolescents may contribute a small proportion (4% in Kenya and 7% in Zimbabwe) [6–8] to the overall HIV-prevalence among pregnant women, PMTCT programs must focus on this vulnerable group, and the young women who have aged into the next age category to achieve the global elimination of MTCT [9].\n\nIn this analysis, we report the observed cumulative risk of MTCT from the perinatal period through 18 months postdelivery among adolescents aged ≤19 years, young women aged 20–24 years, and adult women aged ≥25 years. We also describe the coverage of services along the perinatal PMTCT cascade among these age groups and potential risk factors associated with no ARV use during pregnancy among those whose HIV infection was diagnosed prenatally.\n\nMethods\n\nCase definitions\n\nTo define maternal and infant HIV status, we used a composite of maternal self-report, HIV test results on infant dried blood spot (iDBS) tests, and information extracted from antenatal care (ANC) and child health clinic (CHC) cards. We defined (1) HIV-infected mother if she reported HIV-positive diagnosis with supporting documentation in the ANC or CHC cards or her infant had a baseline iDBS that was positive by HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA); (2) HIV-exposed infant (HEI) if infant born to an HIV-infected mother; and (3) HIV-infected infant if infant had 2 positive iDBS HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests before 18 months of age or 2 reactive rapid HIV tests at 18 months of age.\n\nStudy design, study visits, and data collection\n\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of data from Zimbabwe’s 2013–2014 PMTCT Effectiveness Survey, a prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of mother–infant pairs with infants aged 4–12 weeks. Details of the study design were described elsewhere [10,11]. Briefly, the survey recruited participants from 151 immunization clinics using multistage stratified cluster sampling from all &lt;10 provinces of Zimbabwe [12]. Facilities providing &lt;100 first diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunizations in 2011 (n = 535) were excluded from the sampling frame for logistical considerations. The remaining 1,007 facilities providing ≥100 first diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunizations were divided into three strata based on the number of immunizations provided annually, and 15% of clinics were selected from each stratum using simple random selection without replacement method. All mother–infant pairs were recruited sequentially from each of the selected clinics over 6-week periods. Infants who were severely ill or whose caregivers refused consent were not eligible to participate in the study. From February to August 2013, the primary survey recruited 6,051 pairs of mother–infant aged 4–12 weeks, including 1,171 pairs with HIV-infected mothers and HEIs. These 1,171 pairs were included in the secondary analysis (Figure 1). As 99.7% of caregivers were biological mothers, we refer to all nonbiological caregivers as mothers in this report. After the baseline interview, the mother–infant pairs with HEIs were scheduled for additional visits at 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months postdelivery until the occurrence of one of the following infant events: HIV infection, death, or age 18 months. At all visits, a trained research assistant administered an oral questionnaire and collected the mothers’ responses on a handheld device. The questionnaire elicited maternal and infant characteristics and coverage of ANC and PMTCT services. When possible, information was confirmed with patient-held ANC and CHC cards and medical records.\n\nInfant dried blood spot samples were collected at the baseline for HIV testing for all enrolled infants (HIV antibodies and HIV DNA). HEIs had additional iDBS at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months for HIV DNA testing; and HIV rapid diagnostic testing was performed at 18 months, per national and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations [13]. Clinic nurses returned infant HIV DNA test results to mothers within 4 weeks, and HIV rapid test results were returned to mothers immediately. Routine HIV-related care and treatment services were provided per the national guidelines. All mothers provided written consent at the baseline, and mothers with HEIs provided written consent for the 18-month follow-up at the 6-month visit. In addition, verbal consent was obtained before each blood specimen was collected for HIV testing.\n\nLaboratory-based HIV testing\n\nInfant dried blood spot samples were collected on Munktell-TFN 5-spot paper and sent to the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Harare for serology testing of HIV antibodies using an EIA (Ani labsystem HIV1/2 Ab EIA third generation; Labsystems Diagnostics Oy, Vantaa, Finland). All antibody-positive samples were retested using a second EIA (Enzygnost Anti-HIV1/2 Plus; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH, Marburg/Germany). Baseline iDBS, which tested positive via EIAs and iDBS from infants born to known HIV-infected mothers, were tested for HIV DNA by PCR (COBAS Ampli Prep/COBAS TaqMan-CAP/CTM-Qualitative assay version 1.0 assay; Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ). If the first PCR result was positive or indeterminate, a second PCR (Amplicor HIV-1 DNA Test version 1.5; Roche Diagnostics) was performed to confirm the final result.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nSurvey analysis procedures were used to account for complex survey design, including stratification, weighting, clustering, and nonresponse. Domain analyses were performed on HIV-infected mothers, and the outcome variables were infant HIV infection and maternal ARV use during pregnancy. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 14.1 statistical software.\n\nCompeting risk analysis was used to estimate the cumulative risk of MTCT through 18 months postdelivery by maternal age group using the stcompet package in Stata [14]. We assessed MTCT longitudinally over the 18-month follow-up at 4–12 weeks and 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after delivery. Cox regression analysis was used to test for differences in MTCT by maternal age group.\n\nWe compared demographic, reproductive, and HIV-status variables between age groups of HIV-infected mothers by computing frequencies, weighted proportions, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Demographic and reproductive variables included education level, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), number of pregnancies, planned pregnancy, HIV status of infant’s father, and disclosure of HIV status to family/friends. We defined the SES variable as a composite variable constructed using a clustering algorithm that considered home appliances, water, toilet, house material, income, and fuel quality and access [15].\n\nWe also described the coverage of the PMTCT cascade services during pregnancy and postpartum through study enrollment at 4–12 weeks. The PMTCT cascade includes ANC attendance, HIV testing, knowledge of HIV test result, CD4 count testing, maternal ARV use, and infant ARV prophylaxis.\n\nWe developed a multivariable model using purposeful selection to identify risk factors associated with no ARV use during pregnancy among mothers whose HIV infection was diagnosed before giving birth, using demographic, reproductive, and PMTCT service cascade variables, including time to clinic [16]. Although all mothers were HIV-positive during pregnancy, some were not diagnosed until 4–12 weeks postdelivery and could not start ARVs during pregnancy. Therefore, they were not included in the model. The algorithm began with a univariate screening of each independent variable and the outcome, and variables with p &lt; .25 were included in the initial multivariable model. Then, variables with the largest p value were excluded one at a time, and a smaller model was refitted until all variables had p &lt; .05. Maternal age was retained in the model regardless of the p value. Excluded variables were tested to see if their exclusion caused at least a 20% change in the regression coefficient of the remaining variables in the model, and if so, they were retained in the model. Interactions between biologically plausible variables were evaluated, including age group and timing of HIV diagnosis, and ANC attendance and HIV testing. The final model was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios and associated 95% CI for predictors of interest.\n\nPMTCT clinical guidelines during the study\n\nAt the time of study enrollment (February to August 2013), Zimbabwe national guidelines recommended Option A, in which pregnant and breastfeeding women with WHO stage III/IV or CD4 ≤350 cells/μL were initiated on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART), whereas others received zidovudine ARV prophylaxis [17]. Therefore, in this analysis, ARV initiation for PMTCT includes both ART and ARV prophylaxis. Option B+, in which all pregnant and breastfeeding women are started on lifelong ART, was implemented after study enrollment ended, beginning in November 2013 until it was implemented in all clinics by December 2014 [18,19].\n\nThe Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe, and the Center for Global Health Office of the Associate Director for Science at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved the study protocol.\n\nResults\n\nOf the 6,809 mother–infant pairs approached, 6,051 were eligible and completed the baseline interview (Figure 1). We excluded 251 (4.1%) mother–infant pairs from the analysis because the infants’ HIV exposure or infection status could not be confirmed and excluded one mother–infant pair because the mother’s age was missing. Of the 1,171 HIV-infected mothers, 71 were adolescents (aged 10 to ≤19 years), 255 were young women (aged 20 to ≤24 years), and 845 were adults (aged ≥25 years).\n\nStudy population characteristics\n\nTable 1 shows the weighted HIV prevalence among all adolescents, young women and adults included in the primary survey was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.1%–9.3%), 14.8% (95% CI: 12.8–16.9), and 27.2% (95% CI: 24.7–29.8), respectively (p &lt; .01). Overall HIV prevalence among all adolescents and young women aged ≤24 years was 12.2% (95% CI: 10.8–13.7). Among HIV-infected mothers included in the secondary analysis, parity varied with age (p &lt; .01); 19.1% (95% CI: 11.6–30.0) of adolescents, 69% (95% CI: 62.8–74.6) of young women, and 95% (95% CI: 93.5–96.3) of adults had ≥2 children. Adolescents and young women were more likely to be unsure of the HIV status of the infant’s father, compared with of adults (p = .05). Timing of maternal HIV identification also varied across the three age groups (p &lt; .01); A lower proportion of adolescents were identified at HIV-infected preconception (23.0% [95% CI: 14.4–34.6]), compared with young women and adults (45.6% [95% CI: 38.3–53.1] and 60.5% [95% CI: 55.5–65.3]). A higher proportion of adolescents were identified as HIV-infected during pregnancy (61.9% [95% CI: 48.6–73.6]) compared with 47.6% (95% CI: 40.2–55.1) of young women and 35.4% (95% CI: 30.8–40.3) of adults. All age groups had similar distributions of education, marital status, SES, planned pregnancy, knowledge of HIV status of infant’s father, disclosure of HIV status to family/friends, and breastfeeding practices before study enrollment.\n\nMTCT by maternal age group\n\nAlthough not statistically significant, the cumulative MTCT risk at 18 months was observed to be highest among adolescents followed by young women and adult mothers (12.1%, 7.5%, and 6.9%, respectively; p = .3; Figure 2). The observed MTCT risk measured at 6-week postdelivery was 8.4% for adolescents, 3.2% for young women, and 3.2% for adults.\n\nCoverage of PMTCT cascade services by age group\n\nFigure 3 shows that having ≥1 ANC visit, ≥1 HIV test, and knowledge of the HIV test result was high for all HIV-infected mothers. Greater than 94% of women in all age groups had ≥1 ANC visit, and the mean total number of visits was 4.7 (95% CI: 4.1–5.2), 4.2 (95% CI: 3.9–4.5), and 4.2 (95% CI: 4.1–4.5) for adolescents, young women, and adults, respectively. Gestational age at first ANC visit was also similar between adolescents, young women, and adults (20.9 weeks [95% CI: 19.0–22.9], 21.3 weeks [95% CI: 20.0–22.5], and 20.8 weeks [95% CI: 20.1–21.4], respectively). Approximately 70% of mothers in all age groups reported being tested for HIV only once during pregnancy. Of women who initially tested negative, 30% of adolescents and young women were retested during pregnancy, compared with 21% of adults. Greater than 98% of mothers across all groups received HIV test results during pregnancy.\n\nCD4 count testing varied by age (p ≤ .01). A lower proportion of adolescents received prepartum CD4 count testing (55.0% [95% CI: 42.5–66.9] vs. young women [75.5% (95% CI: 69.0–81.0)] and adults [80.4% (95% CI: 76.6–83.8)]). Use of ARVs for PMTCT varied by maternal age group (p = .02); maternal ARV coverage during pregnancy was 76.8% (95% CI: 65.1–85.5) among adolescents, 83.8% (95% CI: 78.6–87.9) among young women, and 87.8% (95% CI: 84.6–90.4) among adults. Similar proportions of women in all age groups who were identified as HIV-infected preconception were not on ARVs; 5.8% (95% CI: .7–34.0) of adolescents, 6.1% (95% CI: 3.5–10.5) of young women, and 4.2% (95% CI: 2.7–6.4) of adults. Our data show a comparable trend of ARV use across all three age groups of mothers whose HIV status were diagnosed postpartum (adolescents 90.5 [78.7–96.1], young women 89.9 [85.8–92.9], adults 91.6 [89.1–93.6]).\n\nInfant ARV prophylaxis was ≥95% for all age groups.\n\nFactors associated with no ARV use during pregnancy\n\nIn multivariable analysis (Table 2), no ANC attendance (adjusted odds ratio: 7.7 [95% CI: 3.7–16.0]), no HIV testing (7.3 [95% CI: 2.3–23.5]), no prepartum CD4 count testing (2.1 [95% CI: 1.3–3.4]), and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy (2.9 [95% CI: 1.8–4.8]) were associated with increased odds of no ARV use during pregnancy among women whose HIV infection was diagnosed prenatally. Age was not an independent risk factor. Socioeconomic status, time to clinic, parity, education, marital status, knowledge of HIV status of infant’s father, and planned pregnancy were not significant.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCompared with the national risk of early MTCT measured at 4–12 weeks (3.6%) and cumulative MTCT at 18 months postdelivery (7.0%) reported by Dinh et al. [11], our analysis showed that both early and cumulative MTCT risk was higher in adolescents (8.4% and 12.1%) and young women (3.2% and 7.5%) than in adults mothers (3.2% and 6.9%). Although the observed MTCT risk in our analysis did not differ statistically across the three groups of mothers, the elevated MTCT risk among adolescent mothers is consistent with our finding of more HIV diagnosis during pregnancy as opposed to preconception and lower ARV use during pregnancy among this same group. Horwood et al. [2] found higher MTCT at 4–8 weeks of age among adolescent mothers compared with adult mothers, 10.8% versus 6.1%, respectively, in a 2008–2009 study in South Africa. Similarly, Ramraj et al. [4] found adolescents in three consecutive surveys conducted in South Africa had higher MTCT risk measured at 4–8 weeks postdelivery (5.8%–7.2%) than adults (2.4%–3.2%) from 2010 to 2013. Fatti et al. [20] found that the MTCT risk measured at 6 weeks was 3.4% across all ages in a study from South Africa in 2009–2012. However, Fatti et al. [20] reported in the same paper that adolescents and young women had increased risks of MTCT compared with adults with adjusted risk ratios of 4.5 and 2.8, respectively. We are unaware of other studies that have looked at the cumulative risk of MTCT at 18 months in adolescents and young women.\n\nOur study showed a much higher HIV prevalence among women aged ≤24 years than other studies in Zimbabwe (12.2% for all women aged ≤24 years), and HIV prevalence of 7.5% for adolescents and 14.8% for young women. Before widespread ARV availability, Gonese et al. [21] showed HIV prevalence for women aged 15–24 years was between 11.0% and 13.3% in Zimbabwe. More recently, the 2015–2016 Zimbabwe Population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey estimated an HIV prevalence of 5.9% among all females; 2.8% for ages 10–14 years, 3.9% for ages 15–19 years, and 8.1% for ages 20–24 years [22,23]. We would expect our prevalence to be higher than the national prevalence since the adolescents and young women included in our analysis have all been pregnant, and thus sexually active and at higher risk of HIV-infection. In our study, 69.0% of young women had two children or more, compared with 19.1% of adolescents. In addition, we expect prevalence to be higher in young women than adolescents because both adolescents and young women are living longer because of high ART coverage and early ART initiation.\n\nWe found that HIV-infected women of all ages had similar and very high coverage of ≥1 ANC visit (&gt;94%), ≥1 HIV test during ANC (&gt;95%), and knowledge of HIV test results during ANC (&gt;98%). In Sub-Saharan Africa, Wong et al. found only one in five HIV-infected adolescent girls knew their HIV status (20%), and Fatti et al. reported in 2014 that 75.3% of adolescent women were unaware of their HIV status in Eastern Cape, South Africa [20,24]. Although these studies are among all adolescents, our high percentages of HIV test result knowledge during pregnancy may indicate that the national PMTCT program in Zimbabwe was in an advanced stage compared with other countries in the region.\n\nDespite similar coverage for the first three steps in the PMTCT cascade, our analysis revealed that the coverage of CD4 count testing and maternal ARV use in pregnancy differs by age and is lower in adolescents. In contrast, Horwood et al. [2] found adolescents and adults had similar coverage of ARV or ART in 2008–2009, but more adult mothers received the full-recommended PMTCT regimen than adolescent mothers. Musarandega et al. [7] also found similar ARV uptake among adolescents and adults who knew their status in Zimbabwe in 2011–2013; however, our study differs in that coverage of ARVs in the perinatal PMTCT cascade includes mothers who were identified as HIV-infected postpartum. Because a higher proportion of women identified postpartum were adolescents and could not start ARVs during pregnancy without an HIV diagnosis, they may contribute to the observed difference in ARV use by age.\n\nAlthough more than 95% of mothers in all three populations in our analysis were tested for HIV at the first ANC, only 30% of HIV-negative adolescents and young women were retested during pregnancy, compared with 21% of adults. These findings are similar to a 2012 study in Zambia that found only 24.5% of women were tested twice or more during pregnancy [25]. The WHO guidelines recommend that HIV testing be offered at 32 weeks of gestation to all pregnant women who had HIV-negative status at the first ANC visit to detect women with HIV seroconversion [26]. This is critical because many adolescents and young women do not know the HIV status of their sex partners. Our data showed that only 50% of both adolescents and young women, compared with 60% of adults, knew the HIV status of the infant’s father. If this guideline is not followed, and a mother has acquired HIV during pregnancy or seroconverted after the first HIV test, then ARVs would not be initiated, and MTCT would be more likely to occur [26–28].\n\nOur multivariable analysis found that no ARV use during pregnancy is associated with no ANC attendance, HIV testing or CD4 count testing, and maternal HIV identification during pregnancy, compared with diagnosis preconception. Diagnosis during pregnancy allows less time to initiate ARVs before delivery, particularly since the median gestational age at first ANC was 21 weeks. Also, prior studies have shown that HIV diagnosis preconception is associated with early ARV initiation [26,29]. Of note, women diagnosed with HIV postpartum could not be included in the multivariable analysis because they were not eligible for ARVs during pregnancy as they had not yet been identified as HIV infected. This entire group of women identified as HIV-infected postpartum were not on ARVs during pregnancy and thus at high risk of MTCT. Importantly, a higher proportion of adolescents were diagnosed postpartum (15.1%), compared with young women (6.8%) and adults (4.1%). As all age groups had similar rates of HIV testing during pregnancy, the higher proportion of postpartum diagnosis in adolescents may suggest an increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy, and therefore elevated MTCT risk for the adolescent population.\n\nThis study has several limitations. The study was not designed to measure the risk of MTCT among adolescents and young women. Although the small number of HIV-infected infants among adolescents and young women is a testament to the overall success of the PMTCT program, research is needed with larger adolescent and young women sample sizes to further understand MTCT rates and risk factors in these age groups. Although some self-reported data on HIV testing and ARV uptake were verified by reviewing ANC and CHC cards, our findings may have been influenced by maternal recall bias. Also, data on timing of HIV status knowledge is not available and may contribute to observed differences. In addition, although immunization rates are about 95% in Zimbabwe, recruitment from immunization clinics would have missed infants who died before age 4–12 weeks or who did not present for immunization. Although the national guidelines now recommended all HIV-infected patients are elegible for ART at the time of diagnosis, similar barriers to uptake still exist. Therefore, our findings are still relevant as they contribute to the knowledge of ARV/ART use in these populations.\n\nTo achieve the global target of elimination of MTCT, attention may be directed toward women who are not initiated on ARVs because of late identification of HIV infection during or after pregnancy. Maternal HIV infection identified during and after pregnancy highlights the importance of repeat HIV testing throughout the pregnancy and breastfeeding period in high-burden settings. In addition, targeted approaches to increase repeat testing and ARV use among pregnant and breastfeeding adolescents and young women, such as youth-friendly services and support groups, may reduce MTCT in these vulnerable age groups and help countries reach MTCT elimination. Furture qualitative studies are needed to understand how to better approach these populations including why some women identified as HIV-infected preconception were not on ARVs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention assisted with protocol development, managing the study, data analysis, and article writing.\n\nFunding Sources\n\nThis work was supported by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) under a Cooperative Agreement between Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the University of Zimbabwe through Department of Community Medicine (U2GGH00315-01).\n\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nMother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main mode of HIV transmission in children under 15 years old. This problem is significant in the Sub-Saharan African countries, where more than 80% of children living with HIV are found. Previous studies in Ethiopia present inconsistent and inconclusive findings on the prevalence and associated factors of MTCT of HIV. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV and its associated factors in Ethiopia.\n\nMETHODS:\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed. All published studies were retrieved using relevant search terms in MEDLINE, PUBMED, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and African Journals Online databases. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used to critically appraise articles. STATA version 14 software was used to perform the Meta-analysis. The I<sup>2</sup> statistics was used to test heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using Begg's and Egger's tests. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was presented using forest plots.\n\nRESULTS:\nA total of nine studies, 3688 mother-baby pairs, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia was 9.93% (95% CI: 7.29, 12.56). The subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Dire Dawa City Administration (15.7%) and lowest in Southern Nations, Nationality and Peoples Region (SNNPR) (4.16%). Associated factors with MTCT of HIV include: mixed feeding, OR = 7.46 (95%CI: 4.71, 11.81), absence of infant ARV prophylaxis, OR = 7.89 (95%CI: 4.32, 14.42), home delivery, OR = 5.08 (95%CI: 2.32, 11.15), and absence of maternal PMTCT intervention, OR = 7.13 (95% CI: 3.31, 15.35).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAlmost one in ten HIV exposed infants become HIV positive in Ethiopia. Factors like: mixed feeding, the absence of infant ARV prophylaxis, home delivery and absence of mother's PMTCT intervention were significantly associated with MTCT of HIV. Therefore, the governmental and non-governmental organizations need to focus on the identified factors and work towards improving the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program.",

            "summary": "**Summary:** The study found that the pooled prevalence of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in Ethiopia is 9.93%. This indicates that nearly 10% of HIV-exposed infants acquire the virus from their mothers. The study also identified significant factors associated with increased MTCT risk, including mixed feeding practices, lack of infant antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis, home delivery, and absence of maternal prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions.\n\n**Study Design:** Systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n**Sample Size:** 3688 mother-baby pairs.\n\n**Study Population:** The study focused on mother-baby pairs in Ethiopia, encompassing various regions with differing MTCT prevalence rates.\n\n**Risk of Bias:** The study employed a systematic approach following PRISMA guidelines and used the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for critical appraisal, which helps in minimizing bias.

This problem is significant in the Sub-Saharan African countries, where more than 80% of children living with HIV are found. Previous studies in Ethiopia present inconsistent and inconclusive findings on the prevalence and associated factors of MTCT of HIV. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV and its associated factors in Ethiopia.\n\nMethods\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed. All published studies were retrieved using relevant search terms in MEDLINE, PUBMED, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and African Journals Online databases. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used to critically appraise articles. STATA version 14 software was used to perform the Meta-analysis. The I2 statistics was used to test heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using Begg’s and Egger’s tests. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was presented using forest plots.\n\nResults\nA total of nine studies, 3688 mother-baby pairs, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia was 9.93% (95% CI: 7.29, 12.56). The subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Dire Dawa City Administration (15.7%) and lowest in Southern Nations, Nationality and Peoples Region (SNNPR) (4.16%). Associated factors with MTCT of HIV include: mixed feeding, OR = 7.46 (95%CI: 4.71, 11.81), absence of infant ARV prophylaxis, OR = 7.89 (95%CI: 4.32, 14.42), home delivery, OR = 5.08 (95%CI: 2.32, 11.15), and absence of maternal PMTCT intervention, OR = 7.13 (95% CI: 3.31, 15.35).\n\nConclusions\nAlmost one in ten HIV exposed infants become HIV positive in Ethiopia. Factors like: mixed feeding, the absence of infant ARV prophylaxis, home delivery and absence of mother’s PMTCT intervention were significantly associated with MTCT of HIV. Therefore, the governmental and non-governmental organizations need to focus on the identified factors and work towards improving the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program.\n\nKeywords\nHIVPMTCTMTCTPrevalence of MTCT of HIVVertical HIV transmissionHIV-exposed infantSystematic reviewMeta-analysisEthiopiaissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2018\n==== Body\nBackground\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that weakens the immune system of an individual exposing the body to several opportunistic infections [1]. Although the main mode of HIV transmission is through unprotected sexual intercourse, a significant number of vertical transmission also occurs from mother to child. Mother to child transmission (MTCT) is when HIV is transmitted from the mother to the child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding [1–3].\n\nThe prevalence of HIV/AIDS has rapidly increased since the 1980s in developing countries. As a result, it has led to several demographic, economic and social consequences [4]. More than 2 million children are living with HIV/AIDS globally, in which more than 80% of them live in sub-Saharan African countries [5]. For example in 2012, 260,000 new pediatric HIV infections occurred, and most of these infections were in Sub-Saharan Africa [6]. The most seriously affected areas in Africa include Southern and Eastern African countries [4]. Hence, the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set the 90-90-90 target by 2020. The target aims to end the epidemics of HIV by 2030 [7]. The post-2015 HIV priorities plan to dramatically reduce the annual new HIV infection and thereby to save the lives of many peoples [8, 9].\n\nEthiopia is one of the Eastern African countries with adult HIV prevalence of 1.5% in the population aged 15–49 years old. The prevalence is relatively higher among women than men, with a prevalence of 1.9 and 1.0%, respectively [1]. In 2013, there were more than 160,000 HIV positive children (aged less than 15 years’) in Ethiopia. In addition, the number of orphaned children due to HIV/AIDS were 800, 000. Even though there are a higher number of children with HIV, ART coverage among children was only 12% in the same year [10]. Nonetheless, studies conducted in Ethiopia have shown that the fertility desire among HIV-positive women is still high [11]. For this reason, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) adopted a prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program aimed at eliminating mother to child transmission of HIV in 2011. PMTCT is a program designed to provide effective interventions during pregnancy, labor and delivery and breastfeeding period for the mother and the baby. The intervention includes the provision of ARV drugs for the mother and the baby and HIV preventive practices. In the absence of such interventions, the risk of MTCT of HIV is 15 to 45% [9]. But through the use of ARV drugs and appropriate preventive mechanisms, the risk can be reduced to less than 5% in under-resourced settings like Ethiopia [2, 3, 9].\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the prevalence of MTCT of HIV and its associated factors in Ethiopia. However, available studies present inconsistent and inconclusive findings in the prevalence of MTCT of HIV and its associated factors. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to assess the prevalence and factors associated with mother to child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia using available published evidence. The findings of this study will be useful in the design and implementation of proper strategies to reduce the high rate of MTCT of HIV. Likewise, it will be used to monitor the progress of PMTCT program towards Sustainable development goal (SDG-3), target 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, which aims to ensure healthy lives, end preventable deaths of newborn, and end the epidemics of AIDS by 2030 [12].\n\nMethods\nStudy design and search strategy\nThis study utilized a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was strictly followed during the review and meta-analysis [13]. Published studies were searched in Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PUBMED, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and African Journals Online databases. This review included all studies which were published from April 2010 to July 7, 2017. The search terms used were “prevalence of Mother to child transmission of HIV OR prevalence of MTCT of HIV OR factors associated with mother to child transmission of HIV OR HIV-exposed infant OR prevention of mother to child transmission OR PMTCT AND Ethiopia.”\n\nStudy selection and eligibility criteria\nThis review included all published studies conducted to assess the rate of HIV transmission from mother to child and its associated factors in Ethiopia. All available studies were included without restricting to a specific study design. The reference list of already selected studies was also screened to retrieve additional articles which can be included in the meta-analysis. Studies published only in the English language were included.\n\nQuality assessment and data collection\nAssessment of articles using their title, abstract, and a full review of the manuscripts was done before the inclusion of articles in the final meta-analysis. Critical appraisal was conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) [14]. The criteria included in the instrument includes: random selection of the study sample, clear definition of the criteria for the inclusion of the sample in the study, identification and addressing for confounding factors, use of objective criteria to assess the outcome of interest, reliable measurement of outcome variable and use of appropriate statistical analysis method [14]. The critical appraisal was conducted before the extraction of data. Mean quality score was used to assess the quality of included studies in the meta-analysis. Studies which scored above the mean of the quality score were grouped into the high-quality score, and those below the mean were grouped as the low-quality score.\n\nData extraction was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for prevalence studies [14]. All the necessary information was extracted from the final selected studies using the data extraction tool. The tool contains information on author name and year of publication, study area, study design, study period, time of infant HIV diagnosis, sample size, prevalence of MTCT of HIV, and total number of HIV positive and negative infants by breastfeeding option, infant ARV prophylaxis, place of delivery, and mother’s PMTCT intervention status.\n\nOutcome of interest\nThe primary outcome of this review was the prevalence of MTCT of HIV. The Ethiopian national PMTCT guideline recommends diagnosing HIV-exposed infants using the Deoxyribonucleic Acid-Polymerase Chain Reaction (DNA-PCR) virologic tests [9]. The diagnosis is made at six weeks and 18 months using the DNA-PCR test, or rapid antibody test after 6 weeks of breastfeeding cessation. If the child is found to be HIV positive, he/she will be referred to ART clinic for further treatment, care, and support [9]. Additionally, several independent variables were included in this review to determine factors associated with MTCT of HIV. These factors included in this study are: infant breastfeeding option (Exclusive breastfeeding vs mixed feeding), infant ARV prophylaxis (use of prophylaxis vs not using prophylaxis), place of delivery (health facility vs home delivery), and mother’s PMTCT intervention status (received vs not received). The Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) adopted the Option B+ program for PMTCT in August 2012 [9]. Accordingly, subgroup analysis by the study period in this review was categorized as before 2012 and after 2012, to show the prevalence of MTCT of HIV by the PMTCT program update.\n\nHeterogeneity and publication bias\nThe heterogeneity of studies was checked using I2 test statistics and its corresponding p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 was used to declare heterogeneity. I2 statistics of 25, 50 and 75% was used to declare low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively [15]. Egger’s and Begg’s tests were used to assess publication bias, and a p-value less than 0.05 were used to declare its statistical significance [16, 17]. The Duval and Tweedie nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis was conducted for meta-analysis result which showed the presence of publication bias (Egger test, p < 0.05) [18].\n\nStatistical methods and analysis\nThe extracted data were entered into Microsoft Excel and then was exported to STATA version 14 software for meta-analysis. To calculate the overall pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia and its 95% confidence interval (CI), the prevalence rate of MTCT and the standard error (SE) from each study were used. Forest plots were used to present the pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV with 95% CI. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was also presented in forest plot to show the factors associated with MTCT of HIV. Subgroup analysis was conducted by region of the study, study period and quality score of studies. The meta-analysis was conducted using the random effects model of analysis since it minimizes heterogeneity of the included studies [15].\n\nResults\nStudy selection\nA total of 184 records were retrieved through electronic database searching. Records were screened using their titles, abstracts and through full article review. Accordingly, a total of 159 articles were excluded using their title and abstract review. Ten articles were assessed for eligibility and one article was excluded since the outcome of interest was not reported in the study. Finally, nine articles were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Flow diagram of the studies included in the Meta-analysis\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of included studies\nEight of the studies included in the final analysis were retrospective cohort studies [19–26] and one study was prospective cohort study [27]. The studies used health facility-based PMTCT data which was collected from 2004 to 2015. All studies included mother-baby pairs who were involved in the PMTCT care in the respective health institutions. Three articles were conducted in Amhara region [20, 21, 26], two in Oromia region [22, 24], two in Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia [19, 27], one study in Southern Nations, Nationality and Peoples Region (SNNPR) [23] and one study was conducted in Dire Dawa City administration [25]. The time of infant HIV diagnosis for all of the included studies was at or after six weeks postpartum. The sample size of included studies ranges from a minimum of 71 mother-baby pairs who had a documented HIV test result in Addis Ababa City [27] to 896 in 10 sub-cities in Addis Ababa city [27]. Overall, a total of 3688 mother-baby pairs were included in this review (Table 1). The quality score of included studies ranges from 6 to 9, with a mean quality score ± SD of 8 ± 0.71.Table 1 Summary characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis of the prevalence of mother to child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia\n\nAuthor, year\tStudy area\tStudy design\tStudy period\tSample size\tTime of infant HIV diagnosis\tRate of MTCT of HIV\t\nMirkuzie AH. et al., 2010 [19]\t10 sub-cities in Addis Ababa\tRetrospective cohort study\tFebruary 2004 to August 2009\t896\t> = 6 weeks\t11.8\t\nKoye DN and Zeleke BM., 2013 [20]\tGondar University referral hospital, Amhara\tRetrospective cohort study\tSeptember 2005 to July 2011\t509\t> = 6 weeks\t10%\t\nBerhan Z. et al., 2014 [21]\tSouth Gondar zone, Amhara region\tRetrospective cohort study\tJanuary 1 to December 31, 2012\t434\t> = 6 weeks\t10.1%\t\nDerebe G. et al., 2014 [22]\tSt. Luke Hospital, Woliso town, Oromia\tRetrospective cohort study\tDecember 2009 to March 2010\t426\t> = 6 weeks to 18 months\t9.6%\t\nTadele T. et al., 2014 [23]\tHawassa Referral and Yirgalem General Hospital, SNNPR\tRetrospective cohort study\tSeptember 2007 to August 2013\t485\t> = 6 weeks to 18 months, or rapid antibody test after 6 weeks of breast feeding cessation\t4.16%\t\nKumela K. et al., 2015 [24]\tJimma University Specialized Hospital, Oromia\tRetrospective cohort study\tJanuary 2008 to February 2012\t180\t> = 6 weeks\t15.5%\t\nWudineh F. and Damtew B., 2016 [25]\tDil Chora Referral Hospital, Dire Dawa City\tRetrospective cohort study\tJuly 2005 to July 2013\t382\t> = 6 weeks to 18 months\t15.7%\t\nMoges NA. et al., 2017 [26]\tEast and West Gojjam Zones, Amhara\tRetrospective cohort study\tJuly 2011 to July 2015\t305\t> = 6 weeks to 24 months follow-up\t5.9%\t\nMirkuzie AH. et al., 2011 [27]\t15 health facilities in Addis Ababa\tprospective cohort study\tJanuary to December 2009\t71\tAt 6 weeks postpartum\t8.4%\t\n\n\nPrevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia\nThe prevalence of MTCT of HIV among the included studies ranges from a minimum of 4.16% (95%CI: 2.38, 5.94) in Hawassa University Referral and Yirgalem general hospital, SNNPR [23] to a maximum of 15.7% in DilChora referral hospital, Dire Dawa city administration [25]. A prevalence of 5.9% in East and West Gojjam zones, Amhara region [26], 9.6% in St. Luke Hospital, Woliso town, Oromia region [22], 10% in Gondar University referral hospital, Amhara region [20], and 10.1% in South Gondar zone, Amhara region [21] were also observed. Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia was 9.93% (95% CI; 7.29, 12.56) (Fig. 2). The heterogeneity test showed presence of heterogeneity, I2 = 86.8%, p-value = < 0.001. However, non-significant publication bias was detected, p-value = 0.143.Fig. 2 Pooled prevalence of mother to child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia\n\n\n\nSubgroup analysis\nSubgroup analysis was conducted by different study characteristics. The subgroup analysis by region showed the highest prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Dire Dawa City Administration, 15.7% (95%CI: 12.05, 19.35) and the lowest in SNNPR, 4.16% (95%CI:2.38, 5.94), even though only one article were included to each region. The pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Amhara and Oromia regions were 8.65% (95%CI:5.913, 11.38) and 12.11% (95%CI:6.39, 17.82), respectively. The prevalence of MTCT of HIV before the year 2012 was 11.47 (95%CI: 9.46, 13.48) and it reduces to 9.81% (95%CI: 6.72, 12.91) after 2012. The prevalence of MTCT of HIV by quality score of studies was 10.24% in high-quality score studies and 9.55% in low quality score studies (Table 2).Table 2 Subgroup analyses for the prevalence of mother to child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia\n\nSubgroup\tNumber of included studies\tTotal sample size\tPrevalence (95% CI)\tHeterogeneity statistics\t\nTau-Squared\t\nI\n2\n\tp-value\t\nBy region\t\n Dire Dawa City\t1\t382\t15.70 (12.05, 19.35)\t–\t–\t–\t\n Oromia region\t2\t606\t12.11 (06.39, 17.82)\t12.75\t73.2\t0.053\t\n Addis Ababa City\t2\t967\t11.47 (09.46, 13.48)\t0.00\t0.00\t0.326\t\n Amhara region\t3\t1248\t08.65 (05.91, 11.39)\t3.95\t67.7\t0.045\t\n SNNPR\t1\t485\t04.16 (02.38, 05.94)\t–\t–\t–\t\nBy study period\t\n Before 2012\t2\t967\t11.47 (09.46, 13.48)\t0.00\t0.00\t0.326\t\n After 2012\t7\t2721\t09.81 (06.72, 12.91)\t14.89\t88.2\t< 0.001\t\nBy quality score\t\n Low score\t2\t665\t09.55 (01.00, 20.64)\t60.25\t93.7\t< 0.001\t\n High score\t7\t3023\t10.24 (08.11, 12.38)\t5.68\t72.2\t0.001\t\nTotal\t9\t3688\t09..93 (07.29, 12.57)\t13.28\t86.8\t< 0.001\t\n\n\nMixed feeding and MTCT of HIV\nSix studies, 2541 mother-baby pairs, were included in this category of meta-analysis [20–23, 25, 26]. Except for one study [26], all other included studies showed the presence of association of mixed feeding with a higher risk of MTCT of HIV. The meta-analysis showed a strong association between mixed feeding and MTCT of HIV, OR = 7.46 (95%CI: 4.71, 11.81). The heterogeneity test showed no statistical evidence of heterogeneity; I2 = 27.2%, p-value = 0.231. The Begg’s and Egger’s test for publication bias also showed no statistical evidence of publication bias, p-value = 0.573 and p-value = 0.892 respectively (Fig. 3).Fig. 3 Forest plot displaying the association of selected factors with mother to child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia\n\n\n\nInfant ARV prophylaxis and MTCT of HIV\nA total of five studies, 2115 mother-baby pairs, were included to assess the association of absence of infant ARV prophylaxis with MTCT of HIV [20, 21, 23, 25, 26]. One study showed a non-significant association between use of infant ARV prophylaxis and mother to child transmission of HIV [23]. Whereas the rest of included articles in this category of the meta-analysis showed a significant association. Accordingly, the pooled meta-analysis showed that infants who didn’t receive ARV prophylaxis were more likely to be HIV-infected than their counterparts, OR = 7.89 (95% CI: 4.32, 14.42). The Begg’s and Egger’s test for publication bias showed no statistical evidence of publication bias, p-value = 0.327 and p-value = 0.371, respectively. However, statistically significant heterogeneity was observed, I2 = 68.4%, p-value = 0.013 (Fig. 3).\n\nHome delivery and MTCT of HIV\nFive studies, 2115 mother-baby pairs, were included in this category of meta-analysis [20, 21, 23, 25, 26]. Three of the included studies [20, 21, 25] showed a significant association between home delivery and a higher risk of HIV transmission from mother to the child. Two studies showed no such association [23, 26]. The pooled meta-analysis showed higher odds of MTCT of HIV among HIV positive women who gave birth at home than women who delivered at health facilities in the presence of skilled birth attendants, OR = 5.08 (95%CI = 2.32, 11.15). Significant heterogeneity (I2 = 78.4%, p-value = 0.001) was found. Whereas, the Begg’s and Egger’s tests showed no statistical evidence of publication bias, p-value = 0.142 and p-value = 0.055, respectively (Fig. 3).\n\nAbsence of mother’s PMTCT intervention and MTCT of HIV\nFive studies, 2115 mother-baby pairs, were included to determine the association of PMTCT intervention of the mother during pregnancy, or labor and delivery or the postnatal period and risk of MTCT of HIV [20, 21, 23, 25, 26]. The meta-analysis showed that mothers who didn’t use the recommended PMTCT intervention/s during pregnancy/labor and delivery/breastfeeding period are more than seven times more likely to transmit HIV to their child, OR = 7.13 (95%CI: 3.31, 15.36). Heterogeneity test showed evidence of high heterogeneity, I2 = 78.9% and p-value = 0.001. However, there was non-significant publication bias, Begg’s test = 0.327 and Egger’s test = 0.460 (Fig. 3).\n\nDiscussion\nThis meta-analysis was conducted to identify the pooled prevalence of MTCT of HIV and its associated factors in Ethiopia using the available published studies. The review found a higher prevalence of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia, with the overall pooled prevalence of 9.93% (95%CI: 7.29, 12.56). This progress made is far from what the country had planned to achieve. The post-2015 e-MTCT objective by the nation is to reduce vertical HIV transmission to less than 2% by 2020 [8, 28]. In contrast to the finding of the current study, the previous study conducted in China showed a lower prevalence of MTCT of HIV, 3.9% (95% CI; 3.2, 4.6%) [29]. While a study conducted in South Africa showed a 14% prevalence of MTCT of HIV among infants younger than six weeks and the prevalence was 24% among children aged 3 to 6 months old [30]. A wide variation in the prevalence of MTCT of HIV between developed and developing countries can be attributed to the difference in the sociodemographic, economic, access to Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, health care coverage and health-seeking behavior of the populations. The poor uptake of PMTCT service in developing countries could also be mentioned as a reason for the higher prevalence of MTCT of HIV. Individual-level factors (poor knowledge of pregnant women, lower level of maternal education, and psychological issues) and community level factors (stigma and fear of disclosure) are the common barriers for poor uptake of PMTCT service [31]. Therefore, addressing individual and community level barriers for poor PMTCT service uptake is important to reduce the high rate of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia [31].\n\nOne of the PMTCT interventions recommended by WHO is the provision of ARV prophylaxis immediately after birth for 6–12 weeks [9]. The duration of infant ARV prophylaxis depends on the ART adherence status of the mother [9]. Nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis is recommended for six weeks duration for infants who are breastfeeding, and for 4 to 6 weeks of NVP prophylaxis for infants who are not breastfeeding [6]. The meta-analysis of this review showed that infants who didn’t receive ARV prophylaxis at or after birth are more than seven times more likely to be HIV-infected than an infant who received ARV prophylaxis. Several studies also mentioned the importance of infant ARV prophylaxis in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV [6, 32]. The ARV prophylaxis given to the infant serves as pre or post-exposure prophylaxis to HIV and it can protect the infant against the HIV especially during breastfeeding [6, 32, 33].\n\nThis review also found that infants who were on mixed feeding before the age of six months were more than seven times more likely to be HIV positive than infants who were on exclusive breastfeeding. This could be because mixed feeding is associated with gastrointestinal ulceration secondary to diarrheal disease. As a result, the virus can quickly enter the infant’s bloodstream through the ulcerated gastrointestinal tissue [6, 9, 34, 35]. In light of this, WHO and the current Ethiopian national PMTCT guideline recommends the use of safe infant feeding options which include: exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and initiating complementary foods at six months to 12 months of infant’s life and to avoid mixed feeding before six months of infant’s life [9, 34]. A study conducted in Nigeria also showed a higher risk of HIV infection among HIV exposed infants who were on mixed feeding [36].\n\nThe use of skilled delivery attendance at birth can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the child [1, 37]. The current review also found that HIV positive mothers who deliver at home were five times more likely to have HIV positive child than HIV positive women who attended skilled birth attendant at a health facility. This could be due to the lack of PMTCT interventions during and immediately after labor and delivery for mothers who gave birth at home. Moreover, interventions available at health facilities include the use of standard infection prevention practices, use of partograph to follow the progress of labor, use of ARV prophylaxis, and safe delivery practices [9, 34]. A study conducted in western Europe also found that delivery of the baby by elective cesarean section can prevent mother to child transmission of HIV [38]. A similar finding was also observed in a study conducted in Italy [39].\n\nThe presence of PMTCT intervention during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding period is essential in the reduction of the HIV-positive child [9]. The findings of this review showed that HIV positive women with no PMTCT intervention were more than seven times more likely to have HIV positive child. Likewise, without any maternal and/or child PMTCT intervention, 20 to 45% of infants will be HIV-infected [2, 3, 9]. This could be due to the benefits of ARV drugs in reducing maternal viral load, and thereby reducing the risk of HIV transmission from mother to the child [9, 28]. WHO report also showed that ARV prophylaxis to a woman and her infant could reduce the risk of mother to child transmission to less than 2% [40].\n\nThis review strictly followed the PRISMA guideline during the review and meta-analysis process. All eligible studies on MTCT of HIV were included. However, only studies published in the English language were included. Unpublished research works or government reports were not included in this review. Furthermore, this review included only a few variables associated with MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia, because of the limited number of studies. However, previous studies mentioned older maternal age [26], HIV positive mothers who didn’t follow antenatal care [22], late enrolment to HIV exposed infant follow up clinic [20], short duration of ART regimen [21, 24], low maternal CD4 count (less than 350 cells/cubic mm) at baseline [24], mothers on WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 [22], and low infant birth weight (less than 2500 g) [24] as additional factors associated with MTCT of HIV. The outcome variable may also be affected by other confounding variables not mentioned in this review. Therefore, further nationwide study to assess personal, health service factors and policy-related reasons for a higher rate of MTCT of HIV in Ethiopia is recommended.\n\nConclusions\nThe country has made good progress in reducing the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV. However, the rate of reduction is slow to achieve the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV goal by 2020. Moreover, this review showed that almost one in every ten HIV-exposed infants become HIV positive. The prevalence of MTCT of HIV varies across different regions of the country. Higher risk of MTCT of HIV was observed among HIV exposed infants who didn’t take ARV prophylaxis, who were on mixed feeding before six months of age, who were delivered at home, and whose mother was not on PMTCT intervention. This calls the Ministry of Health and other concerned partners to focus on the identified factors and work towards improving the PMTCT program. The use of ARV prophylaxis by the mother during pregnancy, and breastfeeding period, and use of infant ARV prophylaxis should be strengthened. HIV testing and counseling programs for women and their partner should be enhanced at antenatal, labor and delivery, and postnatal settings. Also, institutional and community-based comprehensive health education programs on the importance of skilled birth attendance, postpartum care and maternal and infant PMTCT interventions is essential. Further studies to identify the national prevalence and possible additional associated factors especially in regions with higher prevalence of MTCT of HIV are needed.\n\nAbbreviations\nARTAntiretroviral therapy\n\nARVAntiretroviral\n\nCIConfidence interval\n\nDNADeoxyribonucleic acid\n\nEDHSEthiopian Demographic and Health Survey\n\ne-MTCTElimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV\n\nFMOHFederal Ministry of Health\n\nHIVHuman immunodeficiency virus\n\nMTCTMother-to-child transmission\n\nOROdds ratio\n\nPCRPolymerase chain reaction\n\nPMTCTPrevention of mother-to-child transmission\n\nSNNPRSouthern Nations, Nationality and Peoples Region\n\nWHOWorld Health Organization\n\nTo authors of studies included in this review.\n\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll data pertaining to this study are contained and presented in this document.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\nGMK involved in the design, selection of articles, data extraction, statistical analysis and manuscript writing of this review.
