		"content": "**Literature Summary:** Among the studies reviewed, the most relevant evidence regarding the transmission of HIV from mother to child comes from an observational study conducted in Burkina Faso, which reported a mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate of 10.42% among HIV-positive pregnant women despite the implementation of a prevention program (Ilboudo et al., 2008). This study involved 379 pregnant women and highlighted that co-infections with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) could increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. However, the study's relatively small sample size and observational design may introduce bias, limiting the generalizability of its findings. Other studies provided in the list did not directly address MTCT rates but rather focused on related aspects of HIV infection or other transmission routes.\n\n**TL;DR:** The available evidence suggests that approximately 10.42% of HIV-positive mothers may transmit the virus to their children, though this estimate may vary due to study limitations.\n\n",

			"abstract": "The aims of this research are: i) to evaluate the prevalence of HHV-8, HBV and HIV among pregnant women, ii) to determine the percentage of these co-infections and iii) to estimate the frequency of the mother-to-child transmission of HIV among HBV and HHV-8 positive mothers. Thus, 379 pregnant women attending ante-natal consultation in Saint Camille Medical Centre were subject to HIV, HHV-8 antibodies and the viral marker Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) detection. We observed 48/379 (12.66%) HIV seropositive subjects. Among them, HIV-1 type infection was predominant (95.83%), only 2/48 (4.17%) subjects had a dual HIV-1 type and HIV-2 type infection, no single HIV-2 type infection was detected. 38/379 (10.02%) subjects were infected by HHV-8 and 30/379 (7.91%) were HBsAg positive. HHV-8 and HIV Co-infections rates were high within HBV positive patients and we had respectively 20.00 and 16.67%. 10.42% HIV positive women were coinfected by HBV while 12.50% were infected by HHV-8. Then, 15.79% subjects HHV-8 positive were co-infected by HBV or HIV. In spite of the PMTCT protocol application, five (10.42%) HIV positive women transmitted the virus to their children. Two HIV positive mothers were co-infected by HHV-8 and one by HBV. Among the 5 HIV infected, one mother (20.0%) was HBV positive and two (40.0%) HHV-8 positive. Although we did not have a large sample which would show large prélalences of the infections, we could put forward that the Co-infection of the HIV with one of these viruses (HBV or HHV-8) could favorite the mother-to-child transmission.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nThe thymus is the organ responsible for the maturation and selection of T lymphocytes and is thus pivotal in allowing the development of a functional immune system. Because in HIV infection cell-mediated immune responses are severely impaired, we studied the role of thymus in the control of the progression of HIV infection to AIDS.\n\nMETHODS:\nThymic volume was analysed by magnetic resonance imaging in 31 vertically HIV-infected children. Plasma HIV viral load and phenotypic and functional cellular immunity-defining parameters were examined in the same patients.\n\nRESULTS:\nThymic volume was not correlated with age or nutritional status; thymic volume was nevertheless correlated with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts and with the percentage and absolute number of CD45RA+CD62L+ (naive) T lymphocytes. In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to proliferate upon tetanus stimulation was directly proportional to thymic volume. Finally, a negative correlation was detected between thymic volume and HIV viral load.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nBecause low HIV plasma viraemia and preserved immune function are favourable prognostic indices in HIV disease, these data indicate that an immunological, thymic-dependent control of the progression of HIV infection might be possible, at least in vertically transmitted HIV infection.",

			"abstract": "OBJECTIVES:\nThe effects of posttest counseling on acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases in patients at a large urban sexually transmitted disease clinic were studied.\n\nMETHODS:\nComparisons were made of the percentage of patients who had a positive gonorrhea culture (or any sexually transmitted disease) in the 6 months before and after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counseling and testing.\n\nRESULTS:\nFor 331 patients counseled about a positive HIV test, the percentage with gonorrhea was 6.3 before and 4.5 after posttest counseling (29% decrease). For 666 patients counseled about a negative test, the percentage with gonorrhea was 2.4 before and 5.0 after posttest counseling (106% increase). With any sexually transmitted disease as the outcome, patients who tested positive for HIV had a 12% decrease and patients who tested negative had a 103% increase after counseling.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nHIV counseling and testing was associated with a moderate decrease in sexually transmitted diseases among patients who tested positive for the virus, but risk increased for patients who tested negative. This suggests a need to improve posttest counseling in this clinic and to assess the effects of counseling and testing in other clinics.",

			"abstract": "The high cumulative incidence of AIDS and the large percentage of AIDS patients with no identified risks in Belle Glade, Florida, were evaluated through case interviews and neighborhood-based seroepidemiologic studies. It was found that of 93 AIDS patients reported between July 1982 and 1 August 1987, 34 could be directly linked to at least one other AIDS patient or to a person with AIDS-related complex by sexual contact, sharing of needles during intravenous drug abuse (or both), or perinatal exposure; of 877 randomly selected adults, 28 had antibodies to HIV; no person over age 60 and none of 138 children aged 2 to 10 years had antibodies to HIV; no clustering of infected persons within households occurred, except in sex partners; and HIV-seropositive adults were more likely than HIV-seronegative adults to be from Haiti, have a lower income, report sex with intravenous drug abusers, and have a history of previous treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The presence of antibodies to five arboviruses prevalent in South Florida or the Caribbean did not correlate significantly with HIV infection. The high cumulative rate of AIDS in Belle Glade appears to be the result of HIV transmission through sexual contact and intravenous drug abuse; the evidence does not suggest transmission of HIV through insects.",

			"abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nSeveral host factors contribute to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression in the absence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Among them, the CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is known to be the main co-receptor used by HIV-1 to enter target cells during the early stages of an HIV-1 infection.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nWe evaluated the association of CCR5<sup>(WT/Δ32)</sup> heterozygosity with HIV-1 reservoir size, lymphocyte differentiation, activation and immunosenescence in adolescents and young adults with perinatally acquired HIV infection receiving cART.\n\nMETHODS:\nCCR5 genotype was analysed in 242 patients with vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection from Paediatric Spanish AIDS Research Network Cohort (coRISpe). Proviral HIV-1 DNA was quantified by digital-droplet PCR, and T-cell phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry in a subset of 24 patients (ten with CCR5<sup>(Δ32/WT)</sup> genotype and 14 with CCR5<sup>(WT/WT)</sup> genotype).\n\nRESULTS:\nTwenty-three patients were heterozygous for the Δ32 genotype but none was homozygous for the mutated CCR5 allele. We observed no difference in the HIV-1 reservoir size (455 and 578 copies of HIV-1 DNA per million CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in individuals with CCR5<sup>(WT/WT)</sup> and CCR5<sup>(Δ32/WT)</sup> genotypes, respectively; p 0.75) or in the immune activation markers between both genotype groups. However, we found that total HIV-1 DNA in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with the percentage of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells: a direct correlation in CCR5<sup>(WT/Δ32)</sup> patients but an inverse correlation in those with the CCR5<sup>(WT/WT)</sup> genotype.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis finding suggests a differential distribution of the viral reservoir compartment in CCR5<sup>(WT/Δ32)</sup> patients with perinatal HIV infection, which is a characteristic that may affect the design of strategies for reservoir elimination.",
