		"content": "**Literature Summary:** Among the studies reviewed, the most relevant evidence regarding the transmission of HIV from mother to child comes from an observational study conducted in Burkina Faso, which reported a mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate of 10.42% among HIV-positive pregnant women despite the implementation of a prevention program (Ilboudo et al., 2008). This study involved 379 pregnant women and highlighted that co-infections with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) could increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. However, the study's relatively small sample size and observational design may introduce bias, limiting the generalizability of its findings. Other studies provided in the list did not directly address MTCT rates but rather focused on related aspects of HIV infection or other transmission routes.\n\n**TL;DR:** The available evidence suggests that approximately 10.42% of HIV-positive mothers may transmit the virus to their children, though this estimate may vary due to study limitations.\n\n",

Reports of morbidity associated with HIV-2 infection in children are also rare. We describe eight children born to mothers who were infected with HIV-2; five developed AIDS, and three were still seropositive at 17-49 months of age. The only apparent route of HIV-2 transmission was from mother to child, except for one child who had been transfused. Three of the children with AIDS died, all having decreased CD4+ lymphocytes and mitogen responses.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nThe use of services to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a serious challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. In the last decade, Burkina Faso has implemented numerous policies to increase the use of PMTCT services by pregnant women and their partners, as well as children. This study assesses trends in the uptake of PMTCT services in Burkina Faso from 2013 to 2020 in order to study the progress and gaps in achieving the national and international targets set for 2020.\n\nMETHODS:\nA repeated cross-sectional analysis was performed using data extracted from district health information software version 2. Percentages were computed for each PMTCT indicator and comparisons between the years were made using a chi-square test for trends with a significance threshold of 5%. Regions were not compared with each other.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe proportion of pregnant women who were tested and received their results significantly increased from 47.9% in 2013 to 84.6% in 2020 (p value < 0.001). Of the 13 regions in the country, only 1 region met the 95% national targets whereas, 6 regions met the 90% international targets for this indicator. The proportions of HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) increased from 90.8% in 2013 to 100% in 2020. In the same period, the proportion of exposed infants who received antiretroviral prophylaxis increased from 64.3% in 2013 to 86.8% in 2020. Only 3 regions reached the national and international targets for this indicator. A positive trend was also observed for the indicator related to screening at 2 months or later of exposed infants using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technic; with the rate rising from 7.4% in 2013 to 75.7% in 2020. However, for this indicator, the national and international targets were not achieved considering the national and regional settings. Concerning the women's partners, the proportion of those who tested for HIV increased from 0.9% in 2013 to 4.5% in 2020, with only 1 region that fully met the national target of 10% in 2020. The prevalence of HIV in this particular group was 0.5% in 2020.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPMTCT indicators show an increase from 2013 to 2020 but with a strong disparity between regions. National and international targets have not been achieved for any indicator; except for those related to women receiving ART. Strengthening strategies to effectively engage women and their partners on the use of PMTCT cascade services could help reduce mother-to-child transmission in Burkina Faso.",

As the virus was initially slow to spread to rural areas in South Africa, Mopani district in Limpopo Province did not experience a high incidence of COVID-19 until the second wave in December 2020. Until then, lockdown measures were more likely than SARS-CoV-2 infections to have an adverse impact on health services.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo analyse HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) indicator trends in Mopani during the COVID-19 lockdown and two COVID-19 waves.\n\nMETHODS:\nUsing monthly data from the District Health Information System from February 2019 to December 2020, we conducted a retrospective review of data elements and indicators that fall into the following domains: primary healthcare head count (HC), HIV, antiretroviral treatment (ART), PMTCT and TB. Aggregated data were analysed, and an interrupted time series analysis was conducted. We assessed percentage changes between the January - March 2020 and April - June 2020 periods, and differences in means for the period April - December 2019 v. the period April - December 2020 were assessed for statistical significance.\n\nRESULTS:\nAt the start of the first wave in April 2020, a statistically significant decline of 10% was recorded for total HC utilisation rates (p=0.1). We also found declines of 665 HIV tests (from 1 608 to 942) and 22 positive HIV tests (from 27 to 4) for children between the ages of 18 months and 14 years (p=0.05), with no recovery. Significant declines were also recorded for children aged &lt;15 years starting (change from 35 to 21) and remaining (change from 4 032 to 3 986) on ART, as well as for adults starting ART (change from 855 to 610) at the onset of the first wave (p=0.01). No significant change was detected in PMTCT and TB indicators during the first wave. Pronounced decreases in HC were recorded in December, during the country's second wave (change from 237 965 to 227 834).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDeclines were recorded for most indicators in Mopani, with HC being affected the most at the start of the first wave and not showing any significant recovery between waves. Strategies are required to mitigate the effects of future COVID-19 waves and encourage positive health-seeking behaviour.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nNo systematic review of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) in China has been performed. We aimed to estimate the uptake of PMTCT programs services in China.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang (Chinese) to identify research studies. Only descriptive epidemiological studies were eligible for this study.\n\nRESULTS:\nA total of 57 eligible cross-section studies were finally included. We estimated that the mean HIV-positive rate of exposed infants was 4.4% (95% CI = 3.2-5.5), and more than 33% of exposed infants had not undergone HIV diagnostic testing. The percentage of initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-positive women was 71.0% (95% CI = 66.3-75.8), and that for initiating antiretroviral prophylaxis (ARP) in exposed infants was 78.3% (95% CI = 74.9-81.8); also, 31.3% (95% CI = 15.5-47.0) of women with HIV and < 1% of exposed infants received the combination of three antiretroviral drugs. There were bigger gap of uptake of PMTCT programs between income levels, and cities with a low income level had a higher percentage of initiating ART in HIV-positive women (80%) and ARP in exposed infants (85%) compared to cities with high-middle income (57% and 65%, respectively) (P<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis paper highlights the need to further scale up PMTCT services in China, especially in regions with the lowest coverage, so that more women can access and utilize them.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nDespite global scale up of interventions for Preventing Mother to child HIV Transmissions (PMTCT), there still remain high pediatric HIV infections, which result from unequal access in resource-constrained settings. Sub-Saharan Africa alone contributes more than 90 % of global Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) burden. As part of efforts to address this, African countries (including Ghana) disproportionately contributing to MTCT burden were earmarked in 2009 for rapid PMTCT interventions scale-up within their primary care system for maternal and child health. In this study, we reviewed records in Ghana, on ANC registrants eligible for PMTCT services to describe regional disparities and national trends in key PMTCT indicators. We also assessed distribution of missed opportunities for testing pregnant women and treating those who are HIV positive across the country. Implications for scaling up HIV-related maternal and child health services to ensure equitable access and eliminate mother-to-child transmissions by 2015 are also discussed.\n\nMETHODS:\nData for this review is National AIDS/STI Control Programme (NACP) regional disaggregated records on registered antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees across the country, who are also eligible to receive PMTCT services. These records cover a period of 3 years (2011-2013). Number of ANC registrants, utilization of HIV Testing and Counseling among ANC registrants, number of HIV positive pregnant women, and number of HIV positive pregnant women initiated on ARVs were extracted. Trends were examined by comparing these indicators over time (2011-2013) and across the ten administrative regions. Descriptive statistics were conducted on the dataset and presented in simple frequencies, proportions and percentages. These are used to determine gaps in utilization of PMTCT services. All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2010 version.\n\nRESULTS:\nAlthough there was a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women, untested ANC registrants increased from 17 % in 2011 to 25 % in 2013. There were varying levels of missed opportunities for testing across the ten regions, which led to a total of 487,725 untested ANC clients during the period under review. In 2013, Greater Accra (31 %), Northern (27 %) and Volta (48 %) regions recorded high percentages of untested ANC clients. Overall, HIV positive pregnant women initiated onto ARVs remarkably increased from 57% (2011) to 82 % (2013), yet about a third (33 %) of them in the Volta and Northern regions did not receive ARVs in 2013.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMissed opportunities to test pregnant women for HIV and also initiate those who are positive on ARVs across all the regions pose challenges to the quest to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ghana. For some regions these missed opportunities mimic previously observed gaps in continuous use of primary care for maternal and child health in those areas. Increased national and regional efforts aimed at improving maternal and child healthcare delivery, as well as HIV-related care, is paramount for ensuring equitable access across the country.",
