    "synthesis": "Literature Summary: The available evidence on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV suggests that the transmission rate can be significantly reduced with effective interventions. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Ter Schiphorst et al. found that the MTCT rate of HIV-2 among antiretroviral therapy-naïve women was 0.2%, which is notably lower than the rate for HIV-1, highlighting the influence of maternal viral load and CD4 cell count on transmission rates (1). Additionally, a retrospective observational study from the Kermanshah PMTCT program reported a 0% transmission rate among infants born to HIV-positive mothers, underscoring the potential effectiveness of PMTCT programs when properly implemented (6). These findings suggest that with appropriate interventions, the transmission of HIV from mother to child can be minimized, although the exact percentage varies depending on the context and effectiveness of the interventions.\n\nTL;DR: The percentage of HIV-positive patients who transmit the virus to their children can be very low, close to 0%, with effective prevention measures.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a pooled estimate of the rate of HIV-2 MTCT and to identify factors influencing the rate of transmission. PubMed and EMBASE were used to identify eligible publications using a sensitive search strategy. All publications until February 2021 were considered; 146 full-text articles were assessed. Observational studies describing the rate of HIV-2 MTCT in a defined HIV-2 infected study population were included. Other publication types and studies describing HIV-1 or dually infected populations were excluded. Nine studies consisting of 901 mother-child pairs in West Africa, France and Portugal were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rate estimate of HIV-2 MTCT for antiretroviral therapy-naïve women was 0.2% (95% CI 0.03 to 1.47%), considerably lower than that for HIV-1. The levels of maternal HIV RNA and CD4 cell count were positively related to the vertical transmission rate. Maternal HIV-2 infection did not significantly affect perinatal mortality. It was concluded that the vertical transmission of HIV-2 is lower than that of HIV-1. Maternal viral load and CD4 cell count appear to influence the rate of HIV-2 MTCT.",

Data were collected through face to face interview using structured and pretested questionnaires and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. <b>Results:</b> Majority of the patients had good adherence to their antiretroviral therapy, 68 (66.00%). Medication side effects, 12 (34.00%) and forgetfulness and distance of the hospital from home, each accounting 11 (31.00%) were the main reasons for nonadherence among nonadherent patients. Frequency of counseling (<i>P</i> = .000), CD4 count (χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.529, <i>P</i> = .000), World Health Organization's clinical stage (χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.515, <i>P</i> = .000), stigma (χ<sup>2</sup> = 70.426, <i>P</i> = .000), and family support (χ<sup>2</sup> = 46.383, <i>P</i> = .000) were found to be associated with patients' medication adherence. <b>Conclusion:</b> The overall patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the study facilities was good. Collaborative work among patients, health care organizations, and the public are necessary to tackle the adherence obstacles and enhance patient adherence to the prescribed medication.",

            "abstract": "The first children with HIV-1 infection were described in 1983. As of 1998, the global HIV epidemic is having a profound impact on the health and survival of children. Almost all HIV infections among young children are due to vertical transmission, and the intrapartum period appears to provide us with a crucial window of opportunity for prevention. Postnatal transmission through breastfeeding also contributes an estimated one third to one half of vertical transmission worldwide. Carefully conducted epidemiologic studies are elucidating the immunologic, virologic, and behavioral factors affecting the risk of HIV-1 transmission from mother to infant and the natural history of HIV disease in perinatally infected children. Transmission of HIV-1 is influenced by many factors, and a high maternal viral load is insufficient to fully explain vertical transmission of HIV-1. Pediatricians and other providers should counsel HIV-infected women about the means available to decrease the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. However, the majority of HIV-infected children are born in the developing world, and a crucial challenge is to identify safe and effective interventions that are feasible in those countries with the most significant HIV burden.",

PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify relevant studies published between January 2000 and April 2014. Rates of HIV serostatus disclosure to any person ranged from 5.0% to 96.7% (pooled estimate: 67.0%, 95% CI: 55.7%-78.3%). Women who chose to disclose their status did so more often to their partners (pooled estimate: 63.9%; 95% CI: 56.7%-71.1%) than to family members (pooled estimate: 40.1; 95% CI: 26.2%-54.0%), friends (pooled estimate: 6.4%; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.8%), or religious leaders (pooled estimate: 7.1%; 95% CI: 4.3%-9.8%). Most women disclosed prior to delivery. Decisions to disclose were associated with factors related to the woman herself (younger age, first pregnancies, knowing someone with HIV, lower levels of internalized stigma, and lower levels of avoidant coping), the partner (prior history of HIV testing and higher levels of educational attainment), their partnership (no history of domestic violence and financial independence), and the household (higher quality of housing and residing without co-spouses or extended family members).

The mothers were mostly infected with HIV via their infected spouse. The pregnancies of 77 cases (82.1%) were in accordance with the national guideline. The average length of treatment for this group was 185 days. Of the 18 mothers who did not receive treatment, nine were diagnosed during childbirth and nine had no available information. All infants born from infected mothers underwent after-birth-antiretroviral prophylaxis, and all remained healthy. There was no statistically significant relationship between the birth weight and height of neonates with maternal age, maternal last viral load, disease stage, education, and maternal CD4 levels.
