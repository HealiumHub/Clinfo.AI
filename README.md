Millions of medical research articles are published every year. Healthcare professionals are expected to know the latest research. However, with limited time and a broad field to cover, keeping up-to-date can be a challenging task.

Clinfo.AI **searches** and **synthesizes** medical literature tailored to a **specific** clinical **question**. By analyzing the context of the inquiry, it identifies and presents the most relevant articles.
