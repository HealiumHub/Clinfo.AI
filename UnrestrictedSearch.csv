allergy and immunology,asthma,Are prenatal anxiety or depression symptoms associated with asthma or atopic diseases throughout the offspring's childhood? An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age. Studies suggested that these conditions might be related to prenatal depression or anxiety. This study aimed to explore the association between prenatal mental disorders and childhood asthma or atopic disease in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, and theÂ Cochrane Library were searched up to May 2020. The primary outcome was childhood asthma and childhood atopic dermatitis. Random-effects models were used because of high heterogeneity indicated by I<sup>2</sup>â>â50% and Q-test Pâ<â0.10.

RESULTS:
A total of 598 studies were initially identified, but nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Prenatal mental disorder was associated with childhood asthma (nâ=â6 studies; ESâ=â1.146, 95%CI: 1.054-1.245, Pâ=â0.001; I<sup>2</sup>â=â93.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001) whereas no significant association was found for childhood atopic dermatitis (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.211, 95%CI: 0.982-1.494, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â78.5%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001). Childhood asthma seems to be related more to depression (nâ=â1 study; ESâ=â1.170, 95%CI: 1.061-1.291, Pâ=â0.002) and anxiety/depression (nâ=â4 studies; ESâ=â1.157, 95%CI: 1.050-1.275, Pâ=â0.073; I<sup>2</sup>â=â95.3%, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>â<â0.001).

CONCLUSION:
This meta-analysis demonstrated that prenatal mental disorders increase the risk of childhood asthma. We limited the included samples to pregnant women to investigate the association between prenatal psychological factors and offspring's physical health. Future studies should include large high-quality cohort studies to investigate the behavioral, environmental, and genetic causes for this association.","Asthma is the most common respiratory disease among children, while atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis affect about 20% of infants under 2Â years of age.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Should we care about Plasmodium vivax and HIV co-infection? A systematic review and a cases series from the Brazilian Amazon.,"BACKGROUND:
Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues. However, evidence on HIV-Plasmodium vivax co-infection (HIV/PvCo) is scarce, with most of the available information related to Plasmodium falciparum on the African continent. It is unclear whether HIV can change the clinical course of vivax malaria and increase the risk of complications. In this study, a systematic review of HIV/PvCo studies was performed, and recent cases from the Brazilian Amazon were included.

METHODS:
Medical records from a tertiary care centre in the Western Brazilian Amazon (2009-2018) were reviewed to identify HIV/PvCo hospitalized patients. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes are reported. Also, a systematic review of published studies on HIV/PvCo was conducted. Metadata, number of HIV/PvCo cases, demographic, clinical, and outcome data were extracted.

RESULTS:
A total of 1,048 vivax malaria patients were hospitalized in the 10-year period; 21 (2.0%) were HIV/PvCo cases, of which 9 (42.9%) had AIDS-defining illnesses. This was the first malaria episode in 11 (52.4%) patients. Seven (33.3%) patients were unaware of their HIV status and were diagnosed on hospitalization. Severe malaria was diagnosed in 5 (23.8%) patients. One patient died. The systematic review search provided 17 articles (12 cross-sectional or longitudinal studies and 5 case report studies). A higher prevalence of studies involved cases in African and Asian countries (35.3 and 29.4%, respectively), and the prevalence of reported co-infections ranged from 0.1 to 60%.

CONCLUSION:
Reports of HIV/PvCo are scarce in the literature, with only a few studies describing clinical and laboratory outcomes. Systematic screening for both co-infections is not routinely performed, and therefore the real prevalence of HIV/PvCo is unknown. This study showed a low prevalence of HIV/PvCo despite the high prevalence of malaria and HIV locally. Even though relatively small, this is the largest case series to describe HIV/PvCo.","Malaria and HIV are two important public health issues.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Bladder Cancer in HIV-infected Adults: An Emerging Issue? Case-Reports and Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES:
Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Albeit bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, it has been rarely reported among HIV-infected patients. We wished to assess the prevalence and characteristics of bladder cancer in HIV-infected patients.

METHODS:
We conducted a single center retrospective study from 1998 to 2013 in a university hospital in Paris. Cases of bladder cancer among HIV-infected patients were identified using the electronic records of the hospital database and of the HIV-infected cohort. Patient characteristics and outcomes were retrieved from patients charts. A systematic review of published cases of bladder cancers in patients with HIV-infection was also performed.

RESULTS:
During the study period we identified 15 HIV-infected patients (0.2% of the cohort) with a bladder cancer. Patients were mostly men (73%) and smokers (67%), with a median age of 56 years at cancer diagnosis. Bladder cancer was diagnosed a median of 14 years after HIV-infection. Most patients were on ART (86%) with median current and nadir CD4 cell counts of 506 and 195 cells/mm3, respectively. Haematuria (73%) was the most frequent presenting symptom and HPV-associated lesions were seen in 6/10 (60%) patients. Histopathology showed transitional cell carcinoma in 80% and a high proportion of tumors with muscle invasion (47%) and high histologic grade (73%). One-year survival rate was 74.6%. The systematic review identified 13 additional cases of urothelial bladder cancers which shared similar features.

CONCLUSIONS:
Bladder cancers in HIV-infected patients remain rare but may occur in relatively young patients with a low nadir CD4 cell count, have aggressive pathological features and can be fatal.","Non-AIDS-related malignancies now represent a frequent cause of death among HIV-infected patients.

allergy and immunology,HIV,Is having sex with other men a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections in male blood donors in Western countries? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.

METHODS:
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.

RESULTS:
Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.

CONCLUSIONS:
High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.","Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested.

allergy and immunology,pediatric allergy,"Atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, or eczema? A systematic review, meta-analysis, and recommendation for uniform use of 'atopic dermatitis'.","BACKGROUND:
The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. It also negatively impacts accurate communication of research in the scientific literature. We sought to determine the most commonly used terms for AD.

METHODS:
A systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (1945-2016) for the terms AD, atopic eczema (AE), and multiple other eczematous disorders.

RESULTS:
In MEDLINE, 33 060 were identified, of which 21 299 (64.4%) publications used the term 'AD', 15 510 (46.9%) 'eczema', and only 2471 (7.5%) AE. Most of these publications used the term AD (82.0%) or eczema (70.8%) without additional nomenclature; only 1.2% used AE alone. Few publications used the terminology 'childhood eczema', 'flexural eczema', 'infantile eczema', 'atopic neurodermatitis', or 'Besnier's prurigo'. AD was rarely used until the late 1970s, after which it became the most commonly used of the three terms and continuously increased until 2015. Atopic eczema decreased between 2008 and 2015. Atopic dermatitis was the most commonly used term in studies across almost all publication types, languages, and journals.

CONCLUSION:
Atopic dermatitis is the most commonly used term and appears to be increasing in popularity. Given that eczema is a nonspecific term that describes the morphological appearance of several forms of dermatitis, we strongly suggest the use of a more specific term, AD, in publications, healthcare clinician training, and patient education. Support from researchers, reviewers, and editors is key to success.","The lack of standardized nomenclature for atopic dermatitis (AD) creates unnecessary confusion for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers.

allergy and immunology,pediatric allergy,Treating asthma with omega-3 fatty acids: where is the evidence? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND:
Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids. Given the interplay between pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, and the less pro-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, it has been thought that the latter could play a key role in treating or preventing asthma. The purpose was to systematically review the scientific-medical literature in order to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence for possible treatment effects of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma.

METHODS:
Medline, Premedline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Health, and, Dissertation Abstracts were searched to April 2003. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT's) of subjects of any age that used any foods or extracts containing omega-3 fatty acids as treatment or prevention for asthma. Data included all asthma related outcomes, potential covariates, characteristics of the study, design, population, intervention/exposure, comparators, and co interventions.

RESULTS:
Ten RCT's were found pertinent to the present report.

CONCLUSION:
Given the largely inconsistent picture within and across respiratory outcomes, it is impossible to determine whether or not omega-3 fatty acids are an efficacious adjuvant or monotherapy for children or adults. Based on this systematic review we recommend a large randomized controlled study of the effects of high-dose encapsulated omega-3 fatty acids on ventilatory and inflammatory measures of asthma controlling diet and other asthma risk factors. This review was limited because Meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to missing data; poorly or heterogeneously defined populations, interventions, intervention-comparator combinations, and outcomes. In addition, small sample sizes made it impossible to meaningfully assess the impact on clinical outcomes of co-variables. Last, few significant effects were found.","Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids.

allergy and immunology,rhinitis and sinusitis,"Taste receptors in chronic rhinosinusitus, what is the evidence? A systematic review.","BACKGROUND:
Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Growing evidence suggests extraoral TRs as relevant biomarkers, but the current understanding is incomplete. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence of extraoral taste receptors in CRS.

METHODS:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus were reviewed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included studies of genotypic and phenotypic T2R/T1R status in CRS patients.

RESULTS:
Twenty-two studies with 3845 patients were included. Seventeen studies evaluated genotype and 10 evaluated taste phenotypes. Four of 6 studies examining the haplotype distribution of the T2R, TAS2R38, demonstrated increased AVI/AVI haplotype (""nontaster"") frequency in CRS. Meanwhile, 2 studies demonstrated decreased bitter sensitivity in CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), whereas 3 other studies reported decreased bitter sensitivity only in CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). Findings regarding sweet sensitivity were mixed. Three studies with cystic fibrosis patients (nÂ =Â 1393) were included. Studies investigating the association between clinical outcomes and TAS2R38 alleles were limited, but the nonfunctional combination of AVI/AVI was associated with increased utilization of sinus surgery and, in CRSsNP patients, with poorer improvement of symptoms postoperatively.

CONCLUSION:
Both genotypic and phenotypic assessments of T2Rs suggest a potential association with CRS, particularly CRSsNP. However, limited evidence and mixed conclusions cloud the role of T2Rs in CRS. Future investigations should aim to increase diverse populations, broaden institutional diversity, examine T1Rs, and utilize uniform assessments.","Bitter and sweet taste receptors (T2Rs and T1Rs), respectively, are involved in the innate immune response of the sinonasal cavity and associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

anesthesiology,pediatric anesthesia,Is thoracoscopy superior to thoracotomy in the treatment of congenital lung malformations? An updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND:
A meta-analysis was performed for a comparison of outcomes between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy for congenital lung malformations (CLM).

METHODS:
Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically for literature aimed mainly at reporting the therapeutic effects for CLM administrated by VATS and thoracotomy.

RESULTS:
A total of 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, involving 2896 subjects. VATS was associated with fewer complications [odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.69], less use of epidural anesthesia (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.23), shorter length of hospital stay [standard mean difference (SMD) -0.98; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.55] and chest drainage (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.17), as compared with thoracotomy. However, thoracotomy showed superiority in reduced operative time (SMD, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.04-0.84). Pearson analysis (Pearson <i>r</i>â=â0.85, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.98, <i>p</i>â=â0.01) and linear regression (<i>R</i> square 0.73) confirmed a positive correlation between percentage of symptomatic cases and conversion in patients using VATS.

CONCLUSION:
VATS is associated with fewer complications, less use of epidural anesthesia, shorter length of stay and length of chest drainage, but longer operative time, as compared with thoracotomy. Symptomatic patients with CLM using VATS may be prone to conversion to thoracotomy.<i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>",A meta-analysis was performed for a comparison of outcomes between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy for congenital lung malformations (CLM).,"Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically for literature aimed mainly at reporting the therapeutic effects for CLM administrated by VATS and thoracotomy.","A total of 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, involving 2896 subjects.

anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is Femoral Nerve Block Superior to Fascia Iliac Block in Hip Surgery? Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND:
Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of FNB compared with FICB are yet to be fully determined.

METHODS:
Electronic databases were systematically searched. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hip surgery were included. Postoperatively, the pain scores at different time points, narcotic requirements in 24âh, mean arterial pressure, spinal anesthesia (SA) time, patient satisfaction, and adverse effect rates between the two groups were extracted throughout the study.

RESULTS:
Fourteen RCTs including 1179 patients were included. Compared to the FICB, FNB decreased the VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and the incidence rate of some side effects (nausea, vomiting, and sedation) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, compared to the FICB, no significant difference was found in the FNB regarding the VAS scores postoperatively at any of the other time points (2âmin, 20âmin, 2âh, 24âh at movement, 48âh at rest, and 48âh at movement). Patients in both groups had similar narcotic needs after 24âh, mean arterial pressure, SA time, and patient satisfaction (<i>P</i> > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
FNB has more advantages in reducing VAS scores postoperatively at 24âh at rest and the odds of some adverse effects. A better quality RCT is needed to properly compare FNB with FICB.","Femoral nerve block (FNB) and fascia iliac compartment block (FICB) are alternative methods of pain relief during hip surgery.

anesthesiology,regional anesthesia,Is local anaesthesia a favourable approach for transcatheter aortic valve implantation? A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing local and general anaesthesia.,"OBJECTIVES:
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the potential favourable effects of local anaesthesia plus sedation (LAS) compared with general anaesthesia (GA) in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

METHODS:
Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and the reference lists of eligible publications were screened for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies published between 1 January 2006 and 26 June 2016 that compare LAS to GA in an adult study population undergoing TAVI. We conducted study quality assessments using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and structured the review according to PRISMA. A meta-analysis calculating the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under the assumption of a random-effects model was performed. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the IÂ² statistic and Cochran's Q-test.

RESULTS:
After database screening, one RCT and 19 observational studies were included in the review. We found no differences between LAS and GA in terms of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and other endpoints that addressed safety and complication rates. LAS was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay and with lower rates of catecholamine administration and red blood cell transfusion. New pacemaker implantations occurred more frequently under LAS. The overall conversion rate from LAS to GA was 6.2%.

CONCLUSION:
For TAVI, both LAS and GA are feasible and safe. LAS may have some benefits such as increased haemodynamic stability and shorter hospital and ICU stays, but it does not impact 30-day mortality. Since there is a paucity of randomised trial data and the findings are mainly based on observational study data, this review should be considered as a hypothesis-generating article for subsequent RCTs that are required to confirm the potential favourable effects we detected for LAS.

anesthesiology,surgical critical care,How does the implementation of a patient pathway-based intervention in the acute care of blunt thoracic injury impact on patient outcomes? A systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND:
Blunt thoracic injury is present in around 15% of all major trauma presentations. To ensure a standardised approach to the management of physical injury, patient pathway-based interventions have been established in many healthcare settings. It currently remains unclear how these complex interventions are implemented and evaluated in the literature. This systematic review aims to identify pathway effectiveness literature and implementation studies in relation to patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury care.

METHODS:
The databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, WHO Clinical Trials Register and both the GreyLit & OpenGrey databases were searched without restrictions on date or study type. A search strategy was developed including keywords and MeSH terms relating to blunt thoracic injury, patient pathway-based interventions, evaluation and implementation. Due to heterogeneity of intervention pathways, meta-analysis was not possible; analysis was undertaken using an iterative narrative approach.

RESULTS:
A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in analysis. Pathways were identified covering analgesic management, respiratory care, surgical decision making and reducing risk of complications. Studies evaluating pathways are generally limited by their observational and retrospective design, but results highlight the potential benefits of pathway driven care provision in blunt thoracic injury.

CONCLUSIONS:
The results demonstrate the complexity of evaluating patient pathway-based interventions in blunt thoracic injury management. It is important that pathways undergo rigorous evaluation, refinement and validation to ensure quality and patient safety. Strong recommendations are precluded as the quality of the pathway evaluation studies are low.","Blunt thoracic injury is present in around 15% of all major trauma presentations.
